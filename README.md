# Piyush - Nikhil collaboration repo

Private repo for collaboration between Piyush and Nikhil to explore and build AI-powered workflow solutions for businesses.

## Overview

This repository is a space for developing business ideas around AI workflows. We experiment with tools, build projects, and accumulate knowledge across business and technical domains.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized around capabilities, delivery, and ideation.

### Tools

Technical capabilities - reusable utilities and scripts that can be used across multiple projects.

- Put things here that are generic, composable building blocks
- Examples: transcription utilities, file converters, data processors
- Each tool is self-contained with its own documentation

### Operations

Process capabilities - standard operating procedures and workflows that define how we work.

- Each operating procedure gets its own directory containing the SOP and any related templates or resources
- Examples: client intake, discovery process, proposal development
- These improve over time based on what we learn from projects

### Projects

Delivery vehicles - active development efforts with specific goals and completion criteria.

- Put things here that have clear deliverables and endpoints
- Examples: sparsh (our main project), customer onboarding system, workflow automator
- Each project has its own structure and documentation

### Misc

Notes and ideation - a space for brainstorming and capturing ideas before they become active work.

- Put things here that are still taking shape
- Examples: business vision, business ideas, project ideas
- When an idea is ready to execute, move it to the appropriate location

## How tools, operations, and projects work together

Tools and operations are our capabilities. Projects are how we deliver value to customers. There is an iterative cycle between them:

1. Apply existing tools and operations to a project
2. Identify gaps, friction points, and opportunities while delivering
3. Improve tools and operations based on what we learned
4. Bring those improvements back into the project or future projects

For example:
- We might use a generic transcription tool in the sparsh project
- While using it, we discover we need batch processing or better formatting
- We improve the transcription tool with those features
- The improved tool makes the sparsh project better, and all future projects benefit

This cycle ensures our tools and operations evolve to serve real project needs, not hypothetical requirements.
