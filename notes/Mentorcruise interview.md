## Introduction
Hi, I'm Nikhil! I'm an AI Product Manager at Meta (and formerly Adobe), where I've built and scaled multiple AI products serving billions of individuals and millions of businesses. I'm also a part-time AI educator and mentor. 

Prior to AI Product Management, I advised Fortune 500 companies on AI strategy and implementation as a Consultant at Deloitte. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife Rukma, and my hobbies include reading science fiction & fantasy and weightlifting! 🏋️

## Why did you decide to become a mentor
I love learning — I've earned degrees in computer science, business, logic, and philosophy — and I love helping others learn. As a college student my dream was to become a university professor, dedicating my life to learning and helping others learn. My career goals changed over time as I transitioned from academia to business and technology. But my love for learning and helping others learn has never faded! Being an AI educator and mentor is one small way in which I keep this dream alive! 😊

## How did you get your career start?
When I started my career in 2014 as a Strategy and Analytics Consultant at Deloitte, many of our Fortune 500 clients were asking us to make sense of "Big Data" for their businesses. This sparked my curiosity to learn more about AI and ML to help my clients. I also shared my learnings internally through trainings, and externally by publishing a Deloitte Review white paper on AI.

I then went to grad school at Yale to study business, but focused my elective coursework on Computer Science and Machine Learning. Just when I was learning Natural Language Processing and Language Modeling, OpenAI launched GPT-2, and I was blown away by its possibilities and implications for AI's transformative impact on business and society. 

I decided to pivot my career to focus on AI, and I joined Adobe as an AI Product Manager. While building AI capabilities for Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Acrobat, I spent my evenings and weekends learning Computer Science and Machine Learning; along the way I built some cool AI side projects and a masters degree in CS from UPenn. Soon I was sought after by several big tech companies for my expertise in AI and Product Management, and I was recruited by Meta to work on AI for Ads.
