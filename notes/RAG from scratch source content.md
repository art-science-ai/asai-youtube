# Transcripts
TLDR: The video introduces a new series on Rag (Retrieval Augmented Generation) from scratch, covering basic principles and advancing to more complex topics. Rag allows for incorporating external data into LLMs, enhancing their capabilities. The process involves indexing, retrieval, and generation in three stages. Future videos will delve into advanced methods and techniques related to Rag.

Key points:
- Rag enhances LLMs by incorporating external data not seen during pre-training.
- LLMs have context windows that are expanding, accommodating more information from external sources.
- Rag involves indexing external documents for easy retrieval, generating answers based on the retrieved information.
- The video showcases a code walkthrough demonstrating Rag's functionality, including loading, splitting, embedding, indexing documents, defining prompts, and utilizing LMs for answer generation.
- Future videos will explore Rag components (indexing, retrieval, generation) in more detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of the process.
