Nikhil Maddirala’s Personal Statement for Stanford Interpersonal Dynamics Facilitation Training Program (IDFTP) 2024-25: https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/learning/leadership/interpersonal-dynamics/facilitation-training-program



# Question 1 

What is your primary motivation for participating in this program? What do you hope to get out of it?

My motivation stems from my personal transformation over the past few years. I used to value logic and rationality above all else and lacked strong interpersonal connections. All that changed during the pandemic when I moved in with my wife (then girlfriend) and we struggled with a lot of interpersonal conflict. I started therapy for the first time and began to work intentionally on developing my emotional awareness and empathy, leading to a much deeper connection with my wife. Through this experience I understood the value of deepening relationships through emotional connection, and I became deeply motivated to build stronger connections with the people in my life. 

Strengthening interpersonal relationships is currently one of my highest values and priorities in life. In my personal life, I took a big risk and asked my father to work with me on improving our relationship. In my professional life, I am beginning to make space for emotionally open and authentic conversations with my trusted colleagues. I am currently working towards a promotion into people management, and I hope to bring greater emotional awareness and empathy into this role. I also want to help others experience the breakthroughs in connection that I'm still striving for. For these reasons, I believe the IDFTP program is a great opportunity for me to develop the necessary skills and experiences, and to join a community of people on similar journeys.

  
  

# Question 2

Thinking about your experience(s) as a member of a T-group, what were your personal insights and what was enjoyable or challenging about the training?

What stood out most in my ~50 hours of T-group experiences was the deep emotional connections that I was able to build with groups of strangers in such a short time span. Nurturing this emotional connection through vulnerability and openness has become something that I deeply value, and I consider it to be one of life’s most profound joys. However, this emotional exploration hasn’t been without challenges. My biggest challenge is my mind’s natural tendency to intellectualize and analyze emotions. My mind immediately rushes to analyze what other people are saying rather than simply being present. Recognizing and expressing my own emotions is also a new and challenging growth area for me.

One key insight from my T-group experiences is that by initiating emotional openness I can create a safe space for others to reciprocate. I have since applied this learning to my relationships with various friends, family, and colleagues. Some professional examples include: sharing my mental health challenges with a teammate, expressing heartfelt appreciation for another teammate, and confiding fears about a project’s potential failure to a key stakeholder. Each time, my willingness to be vulnerable not only prompted reciprocity, but also deepened our interpersonal relationships, leading to stronger collaboration and trust.

  

# Question 3

What about your style/abilities/attributes would be an asset to your facilitating and to your own learning?

My growth mindset and my curiosity are my two biggest assets. Whether I am struggling with physical, intellectual, interpersonal, or any other kind of challenge, my growth mindset leads me to believe that I can grow to meet this challenge. And my curiosity motivates me to seek feedback, to understand my challenges, and to explore various paths to overcome them. 

In particular, I have been applying this growth mindset and curiosity to develop my emotional intelligence over the past few years. I am working with my therapist to improve my emotional self-awareness and emotional self-regulation. My wife and I are working with a couples counselor on strengthening our relationship through empathy. I’ve made a lot of progress, and I was extremely proud of the positive feedback I got from my T-group peers (see appendix).

  

# Question 4

What about your style/abilities/attributes might cause difficulty in your facilitating or could interfere with your learning?

I am diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), both of which are associated with restricted emotional awareness and emotional regulation. My natural tendency is to avoid emotion and prioritize logic over feelings. Additionally, my curiosity can be a double-edged sword in interpersonal relationships. While curiosity feeds my analytical mind, it can detract from my ability to empathize and actively listen, leading me to probe for rational explanations rather than connect emotionally.

I recognize these challenges as opportunities for growth and have been actively working to overcome them through therapy and self-improvement. An example of this journey is my insistence on logical explanations from my wife whenever I disagreed with or didn’t understand her decisions. Through therapy, I recognized that this was my own personal obsession that I was imposing upon her. Acknowledgement and awareness of these challenges is the first step towards my growth. However, translating this to real-time awareness remains an ongoing challenge. To address this, my wife and I devised a code-word system to alert me when I am falling into this behavior pattern. I am also working to cultivate this awareness independently rather than relying on external cues.

  

# Question 5

Do you have any training or lived experiences which would enable you to facilitate or contribute to conversations about diversity?

As an Indian immigrant raised across three continents, cross-cultural communication is second-nature to me. Navigating a variety of cross-cultural educational and professional environments has taught me to bridge divides. I hope to use this ability as well as my various group memberships to promote the values of emotional openness, vulnerability, and the benefits of therapy among my family, friends, and professional networks.

Indian men, especially in the American business world, are often stereotyped as analytical. For example, an Indian professor at one of my Yale MBA courses (mis-)diagnosed that I was asking a certain question “because of my engineering background”. In addition to such stereotypes, I also need to overcome some very real Indian cultural norms that are barriers to emotional openness. I already began this challenging and risky process with my father, and I hope to extend my influence beyond my family to my friends and to my professional networks. My dream is to contribute towards fostering a more emotionally connected and empathetic world.
