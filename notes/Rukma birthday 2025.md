Happy birthday bhalucat! 

I'm looking forward to another year of amazing adventures with you and baby bhalu/cat. 

I know you're nervous about this next phase of our adventures, and I am too — but I promise we'll figure out how to be great parents, partners, and adventurers! 

I love you so much, and I always will!
-Bhalu

I'm planning a birthday dinner for my wife and myself - just the two of us. She loves art, culture, literature, and fancy ambiance. Suggest the top 20 unique dinner experiences in San Francisco / Berkeley / Oakland.
