### Requirements and notes 
**Piano + singing**: Comparison of apps for practicing playing piano and singing simultaneously while reading from a score. Comparison should include pricing, feature comparison, etc. Here are some of my requirements:
- Scrolling sheet music with customizable tempo and customizable display options (optional - note labels, colors, etc.)
- Upload my own scores
- MacOS support (ideally web based and cross platform)
- **Piano**: Visual feedback from midi keyboard for piano notes (very important)
- **Singing**: Visual feedback from microphone for vocal notes pitch (very important)
