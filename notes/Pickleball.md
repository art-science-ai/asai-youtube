Hi friends, I’m looking for a singles partner to play once a week at San Mateo Central Park around 7-8am on weekday mornings. Please DM me if you’re interested — we can try it out next week and see if it’s a good fit for both of us.

Why mornings? The courts are usually wide open, so no wait time. Plus, it’s an energizing way to start the day!

Why singles? You get more exercise and more focused practice. And it’s much easier to coordinate two people than four!
