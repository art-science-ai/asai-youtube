- Start with a prepared and practiced  2-minute introduction. 
	- Make sure it is prepared (i.e. you have a bullet point outline) and practiced (i.e. you have practiced saying this out loud multiple times ideally in front of your camera so that you can review your timing and delivery). 
	- The preparation and practice should take you a couple of hours if you're starting from scratch, but it's well worth the effort because you will be delivering this 2-minute introduction in **every single** conversation you have for your job search (including recruiter calls, networking calls, interviews, etc.).
	- Limit it to 2 minutes for conciseness and end with an offer to dig deeper into any of the areas they're interested in.
- Let the recruiter lead the rest of the conversation
	- Recruiters will have a set of questions to gather specific information from potential candidates. Allow them to lead the conversation and ask questions.
	- Make sure the recruiter gets all the information they need. Before moving to your questions, ask "before we move on to my questions, is there anything else I can tell you about myself?"
- End with your top questions that are unanswered; have a prepared list of questions such as:
	- Can you tell me about the hiring process and how I can best prepare for it? What's the timeline?
	- What are the most important skills and experiences you are looking for in a candidate? In general and / or for the specific roles?
	- What open roles would I would be a good fit for right now?
	- If I'm not a good fit for any roles right now, how can I improve my resume, skills, and experiences such that I might be a better fit 6-12 months down the line?
