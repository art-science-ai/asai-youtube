	- This month we lost Saileshwar Reddy — my grand-uncle, my tennis coach, and the person who sparked my lifelong love for racquet sports. His biggest passion in life was tennis, and I'm grateful that he was able to share his passion with me as my coach when I started playing tennis in middle school! 🎾
	  
	  He was a man who was way ahead of his time: While my formal tennis classes were teaching me outdated techniques like the continental-grip forehand, he gave me a modern game with a powerful topspin forehand that I still use today. Back then, there were no YouTube tutorials or detailed breakdowns of tennis technique. But he didn’t let that stop him. He studied professional tennis matches on TV, he painstakingly analyzed the techniques, and he patiently coached me for hundreds of hours.
	  
	  Thanks to him, I developed not only a mean forehand but also a lifelong love for racquet sports — tennis, table tennis, and most recently pickleball. Rest in peace, Saileshwar thatha. Your love for the game, your dedication, and your kindness will always be remembered! 🙏

- Notes
	- My grand-uncle Saileshwar Reddy passed away this week. 
	- He was obsessively passionate about tennis. After his retirement, he lived, breathed, and slept tennis.
	- I feel lucky that I was able to share in his passion.
	- He took me under his wing and coached me for several hours a week for multiple years in the early 2000s. He studied the game by watching professional matches on television, and translated that to teaching me. He spent hundreds of hours giving me personal lessons.
	- It's super impressive how we was able to analyze technique by watching the pros play and translate that into a teachable technique.
	- Today you can find hundreds of technique breakdown videos on YouTube, but back then there was no YouTube, and he discovered all this himself.
	- While my tennis class was teaching me an outdated "continental" forehand which no professional tennis player worth his salt has used in decades, Saileshwar thatha was teaching me to play like the pros with a western / semi-western top-spin forehand.
	- I'm grateful to him for instilling in my my love for playing racquet sports - Tennis, Table Tennis, and Pickleball. And not to mention my mean forehand!  
		- May he rest in peace! 🙏
