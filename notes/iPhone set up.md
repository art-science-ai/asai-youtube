### Set up history
- July 2024 iPhone 13 Pro -> iPhone 15 Pro @ Meta
	- I set up using iCloud restore, but then faced issues with MDM profile
	- Had to work with helpdesk to un-enroll MDM and re-enroll; it was relatively painless, but there was a risk that this wouldn't work and we'd have to restore the iPhone again
