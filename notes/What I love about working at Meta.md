## Top 3 things I love about working at [[Meta]]
- 🌐 Meta's mission, products, and impact
	- As someone who grew up, lived, studied, and worked in 8+ cities across 4 different countries, my community of family and friends is spread far and wide. Therefore I personally care a lot about our mission of "giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together". I intentionally use Meta's products such as Whatsapp, Instagram, and Facebook to stay connected with my various communities and to bring my world closer together. And I love that my work is empowering billions of other people across the world to do the same.
- 🤖 Meta's AI product innovations
	- I'm really passionate about AI professionally and personally. Professionally I've been an AI Product Manager for 5+ years, but I've been engaged with AI as a student and hobbyist ever since 2012. I recently started a podcast and newsletter about AI to share my passion with others.
	- Therefore I love that Meta is now one of the world's leading AI companies. We've open sourced the world's best open source foundation model (LLAMA) and we're bringing AI experiences to billions of users with innovative new products like Meta AI and Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. I love these products, I love sharing these experiences with my family and friends, and I'm extremely proud to be working at the company behind these products.
- 🏢 Meta's culture
	- "Move Fast" (formerly "Move Fast, Break Things") is one of Meta's core values which is founded on empowering employees with trust and autonomy. In most companies your manager may say things like "can you please do this?" When I  joined Meta I was surprised to never hear those words. Instead my managers would say things like "Would you like to do this? It could be a good opportunity because..." always giving me the autonomy to shape my work. I often follow my manager's suggestions, but I also often choose to do other things that I find impactful.

## What I don't love about working at Meta
- "Time well spent" is a problem for Meta. 
	- A lot of my friends and family don't use our products such as Instagram and Facebook. When asked why they respond that their time wouldn't be well spent. They would be happy to stay connected with their friends and family, but are afraid that Meta will try to suck more time
- Culture
	- Lot of overhead in alignment
