Ask for informational interviews: I would rephrase this as "Request for coffee chat about your career and Company". E.g. If you reached out to me saying you want to learn about XYZ role at Meta, I might simply respond saying "sorry, I don't know much about this role." But if you reached out with a general interest in learning about my career, I'd be less likely to say no.


Make it easy for them to respond by including some available time slots, or a direct booking link (e.g. Calendly)!
