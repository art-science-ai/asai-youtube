	- https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilmaddirala/
- List your current and last 2 employers (total 3) along with the role / title you held there.*

	  Deloitte, Strategy and Analytics Consultant (2014 - 2017)
- In 1-3 sentences, what aspect of this Research Fellowship role do you find most exciting?*
	- Researching and synthesizing an abundance of content in a clear way that helps PMs practically to achieve their short-term and long-term goals is what I'm most excited about. I'm also curious to bring a PM lens to this and learn if/how this can be organized and developed into a repeatable process with iterative feedback.
- In 1-3 sentences, what aspect do you find least exciting? (please avoid saying "everything is exciting" or equivalent)*
	- Session facilitation and logistics is what I find least exciting. Although I'm happy to help with this, and I have strong operational and organizational skills, I think this aspect probably doesn't contribute significantly to my learning goals (though I could be wrong)!
- In fewer than 200 words, what makes you a good fit for this fellowship?*
	- (1) Curiosity and empathy: I love learning and helping others learn. My love of learning led me to earn degrees in computer science, business, logic, and philosophy. As an educator and mentor, I help aspiring AI Product Managers achieve their goals of landing PM jobs and learning to build AI products. 
	   
	  (2) PM skills and ambiguity: As an AI Product Manager at Meta and Adobe, I've built and scaled multiple AI products in highly ambiguous and complex product landscapes. I've also advised Fortune 500 companies on AI strategy and implementation as a Consultant at Deloitte.
	  
	  (3) Structure and communication: I excel at communicating in a clear and structured manner and tailoring communication to a wide range of audiences levels (e.g. leadership vs. IC), functions (e.g. Eng vs. legal), etc. 
	   
- In fewer than 100 words, what do you hope to gain from this fellowship?*
	- Shreyas is a role model for a career as a Product Manager turned educator and mentor. I'm an AI Product Manager aspiring to build a second career as an AI educator and mentor. Therefore this fellowship provides me with the opportunity to learn from the very best (Shreyas) in an adjacent field.
- If selected, how confident are you about being able to dedicate an average of 20-25 hours / week for the next 3-6 months?*
	- I'm extremely confident in being able to dedicate 10-15 hours per week, but have medium confidence for 20+ hours. I'm open to negotiation and willing to be flexible (e.g. balancing some weeks with more hours vs. some weeks with less hours). I'm also flexible on the salary, since that is not my primary motivation for this role.
- If selected, when can you realistically start?*
	- **July 2024 onwards**
	- August 2024 onwards
	- September 2024 onwards
