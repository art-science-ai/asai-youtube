## Notes
- Call w/ Vijay
	- Context
		- I'm interested in starting an open source project on AI carnatic music generation. The goal is to generate carnatic music phrases (or entire pieces) in MIDI format that can be used my musicians, composers, and producers of carnatic music.
		- I have some limited knowledge and expertise in this area and can contribute some time and code to this project, but will need to find other contributors. I can also provide limited financial resources (e.g. for compute costs, for hiring an intern, etc.)
	- Questions
		- How to start an open source project? I can start a github repo with some starter code and a readme describing the vision and goals.
		- How do I identify and reach out to people who might be interested in working on this?
			- Universities: IIT Madras, Stanford
			- Companies: AI companies (Meta - MusicGen, Google - Magenta, OpenAI - MuseNet, etc.), music software companies, etc.
			- Individuals: find people on Reddit, Github contributors, music forums, AI forums, etc.
			- Conferences: ?
			- Organizations
				- Carnatic music organizations in Bay Area
		- How would I go about hiring an intern from, say, IIT Madras to work on this open source project? How could I incentivize someone to work on this?
	- Intern job description
		- Value proposition
			- $1000 / INR 1 lakh stipend for 10 weeks @ 10 hrs per week
			- Unique AI + music project to gain hands-on experience on open source AI and music tools
			- 1:1 mentorship from an AI PM at big tech: career coaching, resume review, etc.
			- Networking and introduction to AI professionals in my network
			- Recognition: Github contributions, possible Linkedin recommendation
		- Requirements
			- Proficiency with AI assisted coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Github co-pilot, etc. (bonus: you use advanced features such as model context protocols)
			- Working with AI APIs
			- Basic knowledge of carnatic music and western music
			- Optional
				- Working knowledge of a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as Garageband, Logic Pro, etc.
