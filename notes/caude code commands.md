Create issue

## Goal
Create a detailed Issue on Github based on an initial user prompt. The issue should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement.

## Process

- Receive Initial Prompt: The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
- Ask Clarifying Questions: Before writing the issue, you must ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out).
- - Generate issue description: Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below
-
