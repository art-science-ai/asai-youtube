Email to Amazon
Hi, I shipped my Kindle device to Amazon for repair last year, but I never got the device back. I chatted with Amazon customer service about this on October 10 2023 and they told me the device was lost in transit. They asked me to order a new device which would be fully refunded to me. I have now ordered the new device. Can you please issue the refund? Thank you!
