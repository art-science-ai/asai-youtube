- Capturing [[Obsidian workflow]]
- Message to [[Rob Cooper]]
	- Hey Rob, hope you're doing well! Before Mustafa went on PTO, we aligned on a joint goal between our Signal Growth Ranking team + your Catalog Crawling team: experiment to "Understand the impact of crawled data in ads ranking". This was captured in the old Catalog Crawling roadmap [A] under "L3 Core Capabilities: L4 Use Case Support" as a P0 item. However, I don't see this in the new version of your roadmap [B] and I was wondering if you could clarify whether anything changed between the two roadmaps? Thanks in advance for any clarification you can provide! 😊
