### Query handling
Uploaded Langchain RAG YT transcripts and got a good response for query handling and got good response

- **Multi-Query: 
	- Original prompt: What are the main components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system? [1]
	- Reconstructed prompts: 
		- What is LLM technology and how does it work? [1]
		- What are the specific components of an autonomous agent system? [1]
		- How do these components interact within an LLM-powered agent system? [1]
- **RAG Fusion:
	- Original prompt:** Not specified in the source. [2-4]
	- **Reconstructed prompt:** Cannot provide an example for RAG Fusion as the original prompt is not specified in the provided source. [2-4] However, this method is very similar to Multi-Query. [2] The main difference is that RAG Fusion uses reciprocal rank fusion to consolidate and rank retrieved documents across multiple queries. [2, 3]
- **Stepback Prompting:
	- Original prompt:** What is Task composition for LLM agents? [5]
	- **Reconstructed prompt:** What is the process of Task composition? [5]
- **HyDE:
	- Original prompt:** What are some considerations when building an LLM agent? [6-8]
	- **Reconstructed prompt (Hypothetical Document):** This paper explores the key considerations and best practices for designing and implementing LLM-based agents. We discuss topics such as agent architecture, prompt engineering, memory management, and safety considerations. Our analysis provides insights for developers aiming to build robust and reliable LLM agents for various applications. [6-8]

### Overall questions
Let's break down RAG into 4 key components: (1) Query handling, (2) Indexing, (3) Retrieval, and (3) Generation. For each of the components please provide concrete examples of the problems and the solutions for those problems.
