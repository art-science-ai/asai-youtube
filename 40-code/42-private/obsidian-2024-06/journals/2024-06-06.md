	- A&D teacher and upstream model - 
	- OBA geo-split shipping
		- May or may not ship - won't know until July
	- [[Basic Ads]]
		- Current option is tier 3 - less personalized ads; 1PD is just IID; use DMA classification; IG / FB data is out of scope; non-Ads CPS 1PD needs A&D / A&A treatment
		- A&A feature strategy will be important for BA: we reconstruct features after DP noise added; if other CPS can anonymize data for us, it's better because we can add less noise; alternatively the other CPS can cohort the data for us, which enables us to add less noise 
	- Zonggen's blockers
		- What's the escalation path?
	- OBA attributed features - Zonggen should work on it

- [[SAIL]] review w [[../Imports/capacities_workspace-2024-06-06/Pages/Yuhui]], [[../Imports/capacities_workspace-2024-06-06/Pages/Steven Kannan]], [[../Imports/capacities_workspace-2024-06-06/Pages/Sha Meng]]
	- Yuhui: Make the value proposition more attractive to product teams by emphasizing:
		- Data challenges we solved and how that's relevant to product teams
		- Metrics: focus on product metrics in addition to Ads Score metrics
		- Collaboration model: emphasize that we will supp
		- ort their ML teams development too
	- SAIL -> RAIL
		- Discuss how current approach is fragmented and makes our org seem divided
	- Sha: how do we prioritize our portfolio?
		- Metrics: GAS; 0 -> 1 launches; high visibility products; v0 model adoption
		- Which orgs would benefit more from collaboration (e.g. CDP has more Ranking expertise hence less collab benefit)
		- How much visibility and importance are we getting from this collaboration?
	- Alignment plan
		- Start with Zhen alignment
		- Then org leads will have pre-alignment
		- Align w/ Santanu on SAIL -> RAIL
- 1-1 [[Calvin Shaw]]
	- Intros
		- Calvin is a hardware engineer part of Reality Labs TED audio team; focus on co-existence analysis for audio; e.g. need battery to power audio - need to ensure no co-existence issues between battery and speaker
		- Lot of XFNs they interact with - hardware team, design, etc.; these are the customers; want to know things like "what were the co-existence issues in Supernova Gen-1?"
	- Join forces with GenAI team

- [[../Imports/capacities_workspace-2024-06-06/Pages/Advertiser Inbound AI]] chat w [[MetaGen]] team [[../Imports/capacities_workspace-2024-06-06/Pages/Arun Rao]] [[Tony Nelli]] [[../Imports/capacities_workspace-2024-06-06/Pages/Clara Siegel]]
	- Intro
		- Tony is on MetaGen team; does a lot of customer inbounds - customers are teams across Meta; tracking and dashboards
		- Clara is core platform PM; exploring new use cases, etc.
	- GenAI platform support model
		- High priority GenAI products: Meta AI (external facing)
		- Monetization and internal teams get next level of support
	- What kind of support can you guys provide?
	- Many teams are looking for the same thing
	- Future plans for RAG?
	- My needs
		- More data sources support: Text files; WP
		- More user experience support: Metamate, WP Chat
	- Org structure - for long term strategy
		- Core Platform PM: Clara
		- RAG PM: Tony will help me figure out the PM for RAG 
		- Metamate PM lead: Jonathan Huang
	- Short term support for RAG
		- SWE: Tiago
		- Use MetaGen Feedback group
		- 
- 1-1 [[Prakash A]]
	- 
	- Intro
		- From Hyderabad; worked in management consulting; then PM; Meta has been his customer in multiple startup companies - HR tech (predicting employees who might be poached), sourcing, data AI / App annie (mobile analytics); 
		- Currently in between jobs not focusing on job search; exploring startup ideas
		- Lot of background in knowledge graphs
		- In his current startup - looking into knowledge graphs as grounding
	- Choice of KG
		- All KGs are basically nodes and edges
		- HR context: node is a person with defined attributes; persons have relationships and relationships have properties
	- Building KG from unstructured data
		- Very difficult problem; when big data started people just started dumping data and saying we'll organize it at query time
		- His view is that LLMs are not specifically good at entity relationship extraction; LLMs will hallucinate at this; he wants to use LLMs only for consumption of KG
		- 
	- Using KG for RAG
		- Which query language?
		- LLM can make function calls to knowledge graph

	- What's the overall workflow that inbounds are part of?
		- Lit review: going through WP groups and files 
		- 
		- Inbound project brief: key hypotheses about product and prioritize which advertisers and which questions to ask advertisers; PMM + PM + DS
		- Inbound formats
			- Interviews
			- Surveys for targeted questions (e.g. what values are VO advertisers sending)
		- Interview
			- Interview screening - questions to qualify advertiser
			- Conduct interview based on discussion guide
		- Post-inbound
			- Record sessions for note-taking
			- Write synthesis and recommendations
			- Review with XFN and leads to map onto roadmap
	- Knowledge base
		- Inbounds and synthesis
	- Questions: Pre inbound
		- Validate hypotheses based on past interviews. E.g. "VO optimization advertisers want to scale ROAS, current options don't make it easy"
		- How are advertisers setting up goals in Ads manager?
		- How are advertisers making budget decisions?
		- How do they use the controls to select their bid?
		- Are there any past inbounds related to product X or customer Y?
	- Questions: Post inbound
		- Help with synthesis and debrief
		- What were the key themes emerging from this session? Themes like "budget decisions", "volume vs. value logic", etc.
		- What new themes emerged? E.g. CBO, consistent performance, ROAS predictability, automated controls
	- Questions: Testing Qs
		- What are the primary advertising goals of Stubhub and how do they measure success?
			- Pretty decent; captured key pieces.
		- How does Wayfair make budget decisions for advertising spend?
			- CBO piece is not relevant, but rest seems roughly accurate
		- What are the advertising performance challenges that 4patriots is facing?
			- Gave some recommendations which are not relevant to the Q; answer is roughly correct but missing in details.

	- PSML review
		- SGRAI aligned on framing of SG Ads Score breakdown into mitigation vs. growth
		- AI4SG is our branding
		- Horizontal WS: mitigation, 
		- Vertical WS: 
	- SAIL
		- Split into two pieces - within SG (e.g. speed up LRP) vs. outside SG (iRev enablement)
		- Translate CTX ROAS improvements to long term ROI
