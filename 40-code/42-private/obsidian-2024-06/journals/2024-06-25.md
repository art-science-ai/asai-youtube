- Overall
	- + Clear framework
	- - Not going deep enough
- WHY: solid
	- + Tied to mission
	- +/- Gave a lot of facts about podcasts but not clear why Netflix; need to go one level deeper
	- +/- I had to ask for product mission statement; "Offering varied entertainment content in the audio space"
- WHO: insufficient
	- +/- Stakeholders: consumers, creators (got into some sub-segmentation which was distracting)
	- - Did not consider broader ecosystem
	- + Prioritized consumer with good rationale
	- - Segmented "not listening to podcasts"
	- - Then segmented by genre
	- - Next segmentation - you segmented podcasts not listeners
	- Better answer
		- Where they listen: at home / commuting / gym
		- How much they listen: 
- WHAT: insufficient
	- +/- Listed pain points in terms of user journey
	- +/- Adoption / engagement / retention lens does not show user empathy
	- - Did not use a prioritization framework
	- - Discovery is a good problem to solve, but not one of the ones you listed.
- HOW
	- Ideas - features only
		- Make better recommendations
		- Break shows up into episodes
	-
