## Content
I am attempting to use Obsidian (also looking at Logseq if their sync option ever matures)as a place for notes that are made available to all my devices via Obsidian sync .

The problem I’m running into is how to selectively clip content from the web, PDFs and other media, while retaining the ability to select only the content I want and remove any extraneous contacts, such as ads, sidebars, navigation elements or any content that I don’t need saved. 

I have looked at many different Webb clippers, but none of them seem to offer the consistency and flexibility needed in capturing content from the web. They either capture the entire web page (including navigation elements, ads, etc …) or they only allow text to be selected. I need something that will allow the clipping of audio, video, images, text formatting, and layout while retaining the ability to edit out content I do not wish to save.

Does any such web clipper that integrates with Obsidian exist? I do realize I am asking for a lot of functionality.

I was looking a Zotero, since it has the ability to save PDF documents. However, what I don’t know is, if you have the ability to edit these PDFs and selectively remove or add Contant once it is captured.

Also, the ability to clip, edit and view web content from a mobile device would be incredible.
