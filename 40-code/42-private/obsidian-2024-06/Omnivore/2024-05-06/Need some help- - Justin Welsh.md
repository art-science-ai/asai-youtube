Hi Nikhil,

I saw that you're getting deep into The LinkedIn OS. I hope you're enjoying it.

I'm not sure if you know, but I've been sending out 5 pre-built, proven templates (stuff I've already used) each month to a group of subscribers, that you can use to write better LinkedIn content.

You can only access them if you've purchased one of my courses.

They are great if you:

\- Struggle to come up with ideas

\- Struggle to get great engagement

\- Struggle to produce social media content

The Monthly Templates help overcome those problems and help you see results much faster.

If you want to subscribe, I send out 5 fresh new templates each month on the 15th. 

It's $9/month and you can cancel at any time.
