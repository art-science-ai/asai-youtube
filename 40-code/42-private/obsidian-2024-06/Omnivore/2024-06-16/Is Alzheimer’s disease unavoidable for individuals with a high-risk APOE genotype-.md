Last month, results from a widely publicized study seemed to spell doom for millions of individuals in the US and around the world. Authors Fortea et al. reported that having two copies of the **APOE-ε4 gene variant**, long known to be associated with increased risk of **Alzheimer’s disease** (AD), instead represented a form of genetically determined AD – meaning that, for the roughly **2% of the population** carrying this genotype, development of the disease is not only more likely, it is nearly guaranteed. 

The grim news has naturally been met with alarm and despair, but is the hopelessness justified? Or is this yet another case of **bold claims** and **flashy headlines** without sufficient **scientific validation**?
