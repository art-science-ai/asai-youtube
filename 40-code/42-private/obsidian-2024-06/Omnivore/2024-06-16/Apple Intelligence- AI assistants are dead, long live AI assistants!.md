### Art and Science of AI Podcast | Season 2 Episode 2

Your one-stop-shop for all things Apple Intelligence! In this episode, we discuss the Apple Intelligence announcements from WWDC 2024\. We discuss new AI capabilities in Apple’s apps and in Siri, the all-new AI assistant that can perform actions across multiple apps. We deep-dive into the architecture of Apple Intelligence, with a focus on privacy, and we discuss the implications of Apple Intelligence for users, developers, and the overall AI ecosystem.

## Takeaways

* Apple has integrated AI capabilities into their own apps, making them smarter and more efficient. E.g. the iPad calculator app now has handwriting recognition and math-solving features, the Mail app can proofread, rewrite, and categorize emails using AI, etc.
* Siri has become a smarter AI assistant that can perform actions across multiple apps.
* Apple has introduced the App Intents API for third-party developers to integrate their apps with Siri and the AI ecosystem.
* The advancements in Apple's AI ecosystem have the potential to create an 'iPhone moment' for AI. Apple's AI assistant uses an abstracted version of actions, allowing for predefined intents and custom intents developed by individual apps.
* Apple has on-device models that can handle small workloads and larger models that run on the Apple Private Cloud for more complex tasks. Apple's partnership with OpenAI also allows for the use of third-party models outside Apple’s Private Cloud, but only with the user's permission.
* The implications of Apple's AI assistant are significant for end users, but potentially challenging for the rest of the AI ecosystem. Apple's closed system approach gives them control over the user experience and limits the capabilities of third-party apps.
* The commodification of AI models reduces differentiation and pricing power for model providers.
* There is a tension between the benefits of centralized AI systems and the risks to privacy and security.
