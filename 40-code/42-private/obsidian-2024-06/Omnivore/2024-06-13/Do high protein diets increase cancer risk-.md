Sufficient **protein** consumption is critical for **health and longevity**. Too little protein in the diet leads to **low muscle mass**, which in turn is strongly associated with **increased mortality risk**. We have frequently pointed out why the **Recommended Dietary Allowance** (RDA) of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day is too low, and my team generally recommends a daily intake of at least **twice that amount** – around 1.6 to 2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight. Many active individuals and those seeking to **build muscle** aim for **even higher** levels of protein intake, raising the question: is there such a thing as too much? 

Mechanistic data on the effects of protein on cellular signaling pathways have led to a hypothesis that **excess protein intake** promotes the development and progression of **cancer**, an idea that has been widely spread by advocates for **protein restriction**. However, the fact that a given hypothesis is mechanistically plausible does not necessarily mean that it is true, and in evaluating how protein intake impacts cancer risk, we must adopt a wider perspective. While randomized trials addressing this question are lacking, combining **human epidemiological studies** with a closer look at mechanistic studies paints a more nuanced picture of the relationship between protein and cancer.
