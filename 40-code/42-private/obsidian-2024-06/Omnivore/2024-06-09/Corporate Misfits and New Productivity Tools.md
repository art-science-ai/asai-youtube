_Hello, and happy Sunday! It’s summer blockbuster season, and so far, it seems like no one has noticed. The Memorial Day box office, which officially kicked it off, was down_ 20 percent _from last year, and it’s only been more bad news since then—at the current rate of decline, 2024 ticket sales could be down_ 6–11.5 percent_. We saw_ Furiosa: A Max Max Saga _(epic),_ Challengers _(horny and well done), and_ The Fall Guy _(stupid and fun)._ _Movies are an art form! Go see them in the theater if you want them to endure._ 

_Now, on to everything we published this week, along with our take on the latest tech and business news.—_Kate Lee
