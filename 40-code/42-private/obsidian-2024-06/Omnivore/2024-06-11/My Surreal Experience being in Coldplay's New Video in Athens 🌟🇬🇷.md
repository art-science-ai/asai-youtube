What a weekend. 

**Picture this:** attending a concert at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, an ancient theater in Athens that leaves you in **awe**. Now, imagine that concert is by your favorite band, Coldplay (more **awe**). Putting these two together was an out-of-body experience that left us questioning reality the next morning

It all started when we saw a call for people that want to be on Coldplay's new video, that would be filmed at the 1863-year-old Odeon of Herodes Atticus. We knew our chances were very slim <0.1% but I told my husband we just had to try.

We arrived at the given address and found ourselves **at the end of a 200-meter line** (despite being on time). The scorching 40°C (\~104°F) was pretty intense, we were waiting for over an hour, and the line was barely moving. TV crews were filming us, the the dedicated fans who had dropped everything for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Suddenly - an organizer broke the news that without a 'special bracelet', given to fan clubs and friends & family, we had no chance of getting in. He said that Coldplay made the call because there were ‘some’ extra bracelets but not enough to reach us at that part of the line. People started to leave, but we decided to stay, as by that point we had met everyone on the line, it was people from all over the world, we were having great conversations with people that have a shared love for Coldplay.

Suddenly, the line began to move. To our complete shock we made it to a tent where they collected our phones. There was 0 hesitation for me to give my phone away. I would give my car key card away for that special bracelet, no questions asked. 

Energized by our success, we headed to the ancient theater for yet another wait.

The new line was full of rumors about the nature of the event - a Netflix special? A new song? Would the band even be there? You could feel the anticipation. We were standing at the most beautiful place, under the lit up Parthenon.

Finally, we were handed Coldplay’s signature light-up bracelets (2 each!) and the line started moving. The stage was set with Coldplay's iconic color-sprayed instruments, and we found ourselves \~2 meters away from the microphone. You can imagine the excitement. Especially without phones, being fully present in that moment was priceless.

Then suddenly, **Chris Martin walks in**, no security, no fireworks, no music. 

He stood just two meters away. 

He explained we would be filming the videoclip for their new single. There was a film crew there as well as his drummer / guitarist. 

We were taught a lyric in sign language and started practicing. 

After a few minutes, he said "Ready? Here we go," and the bracelets and the band's jackets lit up, transforming the ancient theater into the most beautiful display of color under the moonlight. 

We shot their new single, “Feels like I’m falling in love”. 

Here’s what it sounds like!

The song was a beautiful anthem of love and optimism - I expected nothing less from Coldplay.

Between takes, Chris Martin interacted with the crowd, answering questions and even inviting a fan to sing. After five takes, it was a wrap, and though we cheered for more, the band had to fly out to their next stop on the tour.

It was a night of magic, music, and unity - one of the most incredible experiences of our lives, and thanks to AI, I can share what that evening felt / looked like with you.
