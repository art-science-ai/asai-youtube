Greetings,

No matter who I’m speaking with - patient, friend, or otherwise - everyone’s favorite aspect of health and longevity is [tactics](https://peterattiamd.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=21bc5f75235505c27ce465f90&id=60763844b7&e=39b3f7ed50). While I’m quick to caution against diving head-first into tactics, I understand the desire - it's my favorite part of the journey also. 

_What exercises should I be doing? Which supplements should I take? Which diet is best for me?_

These are important questions, but the answers are highly individual and need to be informed by your personal goals and risks. This is why I vehemently reject one-size-fits-all magic elixirs around diet, exercise, supplements, and the like - **they don’t exist**. 

In _Early_, you’ll be guided through the important preliminary work necessary to answer these tactical questions for yourself. I’d like to offer you a [sneak peek](https://peterattiamd.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=21bc5f75235505c27ce465f90&id=41c40f5747&e=39b3f7ed50) of the tactical work you’ll do in the program after you’ve resolved those questions.

We put a monumental effort into creating a program capable of meeting you where you are now and taking you where you want to be, in the near and long term.

## Your Personalized Tactical Plans

We’ve created an **interactive demonstration** to highlight unique elements in each of the 5 tactical domains of the _Early_ program - exercise, nutrition, sleep, medications & supplements, and emotional health. [You can access this demonstration here.](https://peterattiamd.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=21bc5f75235505c27ce465f90&id=3b9756011e&e=39b3f7ed50)

As a reminder, this enrollment period will remain **open** until capacity for this cohort has been reached, at which point the period will **close**.

I hope that you’ll **join us** on this journey. Whether you do or not, I’d like to thank you for your continued support, listenership, and our shared commitment to a better, longer life.

\-Peter
