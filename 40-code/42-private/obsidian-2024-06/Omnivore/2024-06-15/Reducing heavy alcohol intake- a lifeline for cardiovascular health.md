**Excessive alcohol consumption** is a pervasive behavior, often with significant implications for both personal and public health. While we’ve recently covered the ongoing debate about the health effects of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption, heavy alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for numerous **adverse health outcomes**, including **major adverse cardiovascular events** (MACE). 

The wealth of evidence supporting a causal link between heavy alcohol use and **cardiovascular disease** certainly might motivate some to reduce their intake, but for many with a long history of heavy drinking, there is a perception that the “damage is already done,” such that any attempt at reducing intake would prove pointless. Thus, understanding and defining the exact impact of changes in drinking habits on cardiovascular health is crucial. Recent research by Kang et al. investigated just this question: can **reducing heavy alcohol intake** to mild, or even moderate levels, significantly lower cardiovascular risk, or **is the “damage already done”?**
