	- I’d like to highly recommend Bilal Jahangir as a valuable addition to Meta. With a proven track record in strategy, operations, and AI-driven transformations, Bilal is an excellent candidate for high-impact roles requiring strategic problem-solving and cross-functional leadership. With 8+ years of experience in consulting, most recently as a Project Leader at BCG, he has led multiple AI and digital transformations for Fortune 500 clients, designing AI-powered operational enhancements to improve service and software delivery speed, automate workflows, and enhance operational efficiency. Beyond AI, Bilal has extensive experience launching and scaling digital products, optimizing demand management strategies, and leading cross-functional teams of engineers, tech architects, and sales professionals to drive execution. His ability to translate complex concepts into actionable business strategies and manage large-scale programs makes him a strong fit for Meta. Bilal would bring immense value to our strategic and operational initiatives, and I strongly endorse him as a strong addition to Meta.
	- Hi XX, hope you're doing well! Just wanted to give you a heads up that I submitted a referral for your open position, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about the candidate. Thanks in advance for your consideration! 😊
