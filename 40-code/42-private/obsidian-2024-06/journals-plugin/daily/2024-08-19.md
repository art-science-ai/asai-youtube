## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Joey Prusa]]
	- FuSG feature enrichment
		- Last half - feature enrichment w 1PD - autofill, LH E.g. User conversions by pixel; add LH conversions now; using FuSG predictions as threshold for conversion label
		- Option A
			- Use existing FuSG model
		- Option B
			- Re-train FuSG model w/ limited input
			- More effort than option A
		- First time we are using FuSG model to enrich features
		- Run QRT early October; start feature authoring mid-September
		- Performance improvement
			- Better than 1PD
		- Joey's role - STO for process; Shuai is TL; Tim
	- Telco features
		- Good offline results last half, but after recent model updates in June, those gains disappeared
		- Lot of features not AAP compliant
		- Still working on MC timeline for compliant features
		- SG + non-SG models:
