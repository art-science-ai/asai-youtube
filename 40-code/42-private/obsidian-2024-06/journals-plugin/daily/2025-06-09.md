## Today's notes
- Transition update
	- Hey folks, couple of updates:
	- Looks like my org change landed in the org chart tool
	- I made an update post here: https://fb.workplace.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02BLhhYuRv35fHqVKQr4M94P1qCVDjUxfnH9vwRqEYDnaUKW3qjRH6pMZyFNMh8rPdl&id=100081878102067
- [[AI Alliance]] llama stack meet w/ [[Amit Sangani]] [[Dave Nielsen]] [[Anthony Annunziata]] [[adam pingel]] etc
	- Objectives
		- validate user value hypothesis
		- drive core project features
		- expand ecosystem of providers and distribution partners
	- Discussion of objectives
		- Amit: Top priority for Meta is to get ISVs to adopt llama-stack; later we work with distribution partners like red-hat to see if we can bundle things with llama-stack distribution
	- Brandon - use cases for ISVs to support
		- RAG
		- Customer support
		- Coding
	- Prioritization of ISVs
		- Use cases
		- Ability to deploy on prem
		- Ability to move fast - sign-up by end of month
	- Prioritization of providers
		- We can stick with existing providers - not super important to add new providers
	- Prioritization of ISVs vs. end customers
		- See who can move fast - we want on prem deployment by October
	- NM actions
		- Prioritize list of customers, ISVs, providers, distro partners to engage with via AI Alliance

- Advertiser AI Agent
	- Hey folks, as I'm transitioning out of the Monetization org, Matthew will be taking over as the PM for this project and working with product leadership (Sagar / Kras). 
	- Matthew - as we discussed earlier today, I believe there's some opportunity for a quick win this half involving
	- Iterate on some of the use cases with our new Metamate AI Agent (I'm happy to continue supporting some of the dev work here at least until the end of this half)
	- Test the AI agent with a couple of recent recorded advertiser interviews and get feedback from the relevant BPM/PM
- [[Meta PM interview]] w [[Daniel Weaver]] - [[leadership and drive]]
