## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Marvin Kim|Marvin Kim]]
	- Note prior to meeting
		- Some more context on this
		- For the past ~2 years the 1PD/IAB ads data use v-team has been operating with shared goals between SG T2 + T4. But there are some new IAB + DMF projects coming up now for which teams don't yet have clarity on the collaboration model and shared goals. 
		- I had been working with the T2 + T4 1PD/IAB ads data use v-team on drafting a proposed collaboration model to align on principles for shared goals. However Fan suggested that it's better to wait for top-down alignment on this topic rather than the v-team figuring out the alignment. I'm assuming this meeting with Krishna is to provide input into this alignment?
	- Next steps
		- I start thread w/ Krishna et al
