	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- Didn't exercise today morning. Was feeling a bit tired and low energy. I think it's okay. Just make sure to do it in the evening. I scheduled it already, just stick to it. Could be a combination of things why I was feeling low energy. Nicotine is one of the things for sure. I know exercise helps with that, so keep at it.
		- What else is on my mind? I was facing a lot of avoidance in work all last week. Push through that and prioritize it as the first thing today. Can't hurt. First session work focus. Then do other things later.
		- Had an amazing weekend especially Sunday with Rukma. We brought back some good practices from our vacation and had a very chill day.

Hey Fred, hope you're doing well! I'm really sorry for disappearing, my bad — I unfortunately got too busy with work and travel to continue weightlifting for now. May I please cancel my Villain Barbell membership? I really appreciate your support as a coach, and I'll hit you up again when I'm able to dedicate more time. Thank you! 😊
