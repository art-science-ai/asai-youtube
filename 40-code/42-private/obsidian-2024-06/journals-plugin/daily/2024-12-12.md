- Email to [[BRUCE TAMBLING]] and [[ERIC KUEHNL]] about music courses
	- tamblingbruce@fhda.edu
	- kuehnleric@fhda.edu
	- Hi XX, I'm interested in taking one of these two courses next quarter, and wanted some advice from you to help inform my decision: (1) MTEC 50A: INTRODUCTION TO MUSIC TECHNOLOGY, and (2) MTEC 62A: COMPOSING & PRODUCING ELECTRONIC MUSIC I
	- My questions
		- Could you share any more information about your course such as a syllabus / list of software & tools / project examples / etc.
		- Do you offer any virtual office hours appointments where I could discuss this with you further? 
	- About myself
		- I work in AI and I have an educational background in computer science and business.
		- I have a beginner level background in piano performance, composition, and music theory. 
		- I recently started experimenting with music production by exporting classical sheet music from Musescore to MIDI and importing into Garageband / Logic to arrange tracks using loops and presets. 
		- My short term goal is to get better at bringing piano and orchestral compositions to life. My long term goal is to make my own classical - electronic fusion music.
	- Thank you very much in advance for any information and insight you are able to provide! 😊
