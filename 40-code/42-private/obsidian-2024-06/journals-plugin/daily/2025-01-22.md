		- Notes
			- A: S S P P | D D P2
			- B: M M G G | R R S2
			- B': P P M M | G G R2
			- A: S S P P | D D P2
			- B: M M G G | R R S2
		- Dynamic notes
			- Single note repeated: first key-y then vibrato
			- Long single note: snake
		- Feedback to me
			- I'm playing vibrato too rhythymicallly - almost like it's on a metronome - it should be slower
	- [[legato vs stoccato]]
		- Legato - notes are tied together - second note begins as first note ends
		- Stoccato - Short notes
		- Pizzicato - even shorter than stoccato - on violin it's plucked rather than bowed - not yet available on geoshred
	- Exercise -next two classes
		- Set octave - 2

- Message to [[Lin Li]]
	- Hey Lin, can you help me understand the distinction between "Signal Growth" and "Data Quality" workstreams in the Value T1 roadmap [A]? I was just talking to the PM on Signals Data Quality side (Nachiket) and it seems like there is some overlap. They are tracking several items under "Signals Value CoE" roadmap [B] which we are also tracking under our Signal Growth roadmap.
