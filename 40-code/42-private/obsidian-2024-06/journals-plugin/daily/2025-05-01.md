## Today's snippets
```txt
**SGP Goals first**: Our primary focus is on maximizing SGP level impact by driving iRev and ROI. We will prioritize projects that align with our shared goals through collaboration between T2 and T4 teams.

**Collaboration over attribution**: Attribution and credit splits should not hinder our ability to work together effectively to drive SGP level impact. While Track leads are in the process of figuring out track-level attribution, this should not have any impact on individual contributors working on these projects, regardless of the eventual track-level attribution.
