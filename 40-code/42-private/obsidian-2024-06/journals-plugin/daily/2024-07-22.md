		- New week! Starting with somewhat low energy. Woke up and didn't want to do exercise. Likely related to drinking a lot yesterday. I think it's fine - it happens, it was a party. Took vyvanse 30mg this morning but still feeling a bit down. I think I need to ensure I'm taking those vyvanse breaks. Need one full day of zero dose per week and an additional 1-2 days of half dose. Let's say 2 days. Make Sunday a clean no-dose day. Why did I change this Sunday? Because I did the podcast and thought it would be helpful. Just cut that out. I can easily do the podcast without it. And at some point also I need a longer break of like 1 week. Maybe when we go to Michigan is a good time for that.
