	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- PPML project is quite annoying for me rn I wish I didn't have to work on it. I should talk to Marvin again and let him know that it's eating up a lot of my time without giving me any value. I want to focus on PSML and SAIL. I think that's fair.
		- How are things going with PSML and SAIL? SAIL I think is going pretty well. I really like the team and they like me. Plus it looks like we're making progress on the strategy now. Xi is a good partner. I am optimistic about this one.
		- PSML is also going pretty well. Especially the web crawl part of it. I like Praveen as a partner - he's great. Much better than Sheela. Mustafa also seems like a good partner. I think I can make some good progress on this one. PSML overall seems like a good strategy too - will work with Xunlong when he's back. All those are good, except PPML.
		- Why did I take on PPML? I have a problem saying yes to too many things!
		- GenAI side project seems to be taking off too. Looks like Assaf / Shyam are interested in it and they seem to have a good opinion of me here. I wonder if I can expand this into a broader strategic initiative around how to use GenAI for ads org more broadly. That's something to think about.

	- Performance debugging use case

Q: Is Generative AI stealing the work of human creators?

1. Motivating examples
- AI can generate stories, music, art, etc. in the style of your favorite writer, musician, artist, etc.


2. Intellectual Property and Copyright

2.a. Public domain vs. copyrighted material
- Most works are copyrighted by default unless the creator explicitly makes them public domain
- After a period of time copyright expires and works pass into public domain

2.b. What is “fair use” of copyrighted material?
- Purpose and Character of the Use: If the use is for commercial purposes or for nonprofit educational purposes. Transformative uses (those that add new expression, meaning, or message) are more likely to be considered fair use.
- Nature of the Copyrighted Work: Use of factual works is more likely to be fair use compared to highly creative works.
- Amount and Substantiality: The quantity and importance of the portion used in relation to the entire work. Using smaller, less significant portions may favor fair use.
- Effect on the Market: If the use affects the market for the original work negatively, it is less likely to be considered fair use.

3. Creativity and Originality
- What is originality?
- What is creativity?

4. AI inputs vs. outputs
- Outputs are visible, but inputs are invisible
