	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- What's on my mind? Didn't quit vaping. Setting a new deadline of 12pm today at the coaching call. Minor failure. But have a solid deadline upcoming. I feel a little bad, but not too much.
		- Did my exercise this morning. Completely winded from lower body exercises. Cardio is shot. Yet another reason to quit vaping. And also to do more cardio - which is already part of the plan! But how? Currently I'm only doing 30m a day on non strength days which is like 2-3 days per week. Need to start incorporating it on strength days too. Starting with upper body days which are easier cardio wise. Ideally I'd do 30 mins cardio first on those days then do the strength training. Also on the non strength days I can up it to 45 mins to start. On lower body 2 day I should do KB swings to help cardio. That'll be a good start. Slow and steady. I just re-started, can progress gradually.
		- Got into argument with Rukma last night which I wish we didn't. We were discussing the HOTD episode we saw and I started to become very argumentative, which I know she doesn't like. I guess there's a part of me that was also feeling rejected by her, because I see this as a core part of my personality. But is it necessarily? Wouldn't I like to be better? There's a way to be argumentative while also being curious. That's how I'd like to be. My current method is too abrasive. Remember to express curiosity, first acknowledge what she's saying and address that directly before jumping into my next chain of thought or argument. How to remember to do this in the moment? This is the key listening and speaking skill I should be practicing in IPD type settings. Listen actively with curiosity before speaking. That hasn't been translating too well into day to day settings. The IPD setting is quite artificial where I'm not feeling passionate or engaged in what is being discussed, which is where I tend to fall into this.
