		- Originally the org was model-led, but now it's shifting to UX led, focusing on social and Meta AI experiences
	- Culture
		- Coming from Monetization - everything was bottoms up; leadership provided high level guidance based on data
		- In GenAI, leadership is very top-down coming from MZ; lot of thrash until it goes to MZ
		- It is definitely stressful environment, but she's okay w/ it for now
	- Job search advice
		- GenAI has tons of demand for PM hiring; each vertical head decide their process and priorities; Chris wanted PM with deeply technical background
