## Today's notes
- [[Advertiser Inbound AI]] w [[Lakhvinder Gaba]] [[Adam Noakes]] [[Fan Xu]] [[Yulai Bi]]
	- Intros
		- Fan - MGP team; offline application
		- Yulai - MGP team; 
	- App details
		- Real time
		- Internal facing
	- Retrieval owned by other team -
	- MGP customer tiers
		- Ads AI - tier 0 customer - using MGP capacity CPUs and GPUs
		- For our use case, we can started with MGP shared resource pool, when we scale up we need to bring our own capacity
		- Shared pool uses LLAMA 2 right now; will migrate to LLAMA 3 around Q3
	- MGP platform overview
		- Apps can start python service to orchestrate applications to connect w/ LLMs, retrieval tools, etc.
	- MGP vs. MetaGen platform
		- MetaGen is like a service; calling model as a service; MGP supports more complex applications - even more support in python application side
		- MGP provides even more support to Tier 0 customers incl. capacity
- PXFN discussion w [[Shalin Sood]] [[Austin Mazella]]
	- In doc
- 1-1 w [[Tanmay Zargar]]
	- Promo narrative: 1PD -> PSML / SAIL

	- Use cases - multi-user workflows with AI - financial services
	- Agentic design and orchestration of multiple workflows

		- Push - 30% - too hard to get promoted and got blocked twice 
		- Pull - 70% - believes in the vision - human AI collaboration
	- Use case - assistant agents
		-  every employee has an assistant
		- I want to set up time with my colleagues
		- I create a slack room and add all the assistants
		- All assistants work together to add the calendar
	- Use case - expert agents
		- Doctor, lawyer, engineer
		- I want an analyst report from last year
		- Expert agents come together
		- Orchestrator builds this together
		- Similar to Crew AI -

			- attribute to whatever touch point user has in past 7 days
			- NE for sure; soon will have PT GAS - check w/ Jesse and Ming
