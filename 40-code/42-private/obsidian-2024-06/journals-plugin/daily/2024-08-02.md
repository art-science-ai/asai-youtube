- 1-1 [[Guang Li]]
	- Intro
		- Guang is now 50% focus on core ML data strategy and 50% on calibration
	- Flywheel
		- Advertiser flywheel - data from advertisers (usually small scale data and takes time to get); need to quickly show the benefit and scale it
		- Internal flywheel - e.g. Midas soft-attribution; signals team has many hypotheses about the data, but don't have end to end way to verify hypotheses; ML side has expertise on using data; quick idea generation flywheel
	- PSML vs. data strategy
		- PSML should focus more on ML techniques
		- Data strategy should be broader
	- How to get there?
		- Analytical sizing of insights
		- Offline evaluation and hypothesis testing
		- Need quick experimentation; can't move ads score 
		- Platformizing ML techniques; lot of ML is specific to individual data; need hypotheses on which techniques map to which types of data
	- Other initiatives - related
		- LTT ML techniques - agnostic to data - e.g. foundation models, semi-supervised, etc.
		- 
	- List of opportunities
	- People and process

			- Monitoring
			- Authoring
			- Assisting
			- Conversing
		- Frustration within org about silos and lack of transparency
	- Project: ChatNow
		- Chatbot handles service desk questions
		- Low adoption
		- Trying to force adoption imposing from top-down
		- Product sucks, very little data
		- Need to do some research to figure out what's going wrong
		- Team says no time - October 1st is the deadline
	- Approaches for improving
		- UX hacks to get more adoption
			- Putting the bot in the phone even though its not helpful
			- Putting chatbot in popups everywhere to help users
		- Fundamental solution to create a good product
	- Product sense: chat now
		- Why?
			- Address super high number of service tickets - password reset, need new machine, etc. - reduce number of tickets
			- Free up service tech time; employees; free up their time
		- Who 
			- End users - first set of users is the IT team
			- Service desk IT employees - service providers
		- What problems
			- Create incident
			- Unlock device
			- Show approvals
			- Show tickets
		- E.g. use case
			- Yves couldn't log into a specific site and wanted an answer
		- Solutions
		- 
- 1-1 [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Marvin Kim|Marvin Kim]]
	- Data strategy
		- Internal alignment
			- Don't frame it as "getting alignment"; frame it as "we want to get together and see if we can put together a case for napkin"
			- Focus on getting excited on the idea rather than grouping multiple things together
		- Signals alignment
			- Again, don't call it "alignment". Focus on traction.
			- Know who is influential
