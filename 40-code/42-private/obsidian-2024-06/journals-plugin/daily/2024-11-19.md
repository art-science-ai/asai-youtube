## Today's notes
- Meet w [[Austin Mazella]] [[Josh Gluck]] [[Praveen Sampath]]
	- Right to crawl - advertiser terms risk
		- Catalog terms allow us to crawl advertiser websites. For advertisers who have not signed catalog terms, crawling is a significant risk.
		- Solution: we need to change advertiser terms or communicate to advertisers in some other way with an opt-out for advertisers
	- Linkage to user data risk
		- Determining which URLs to crawl based on user data (e.g. user's behavioral data from In App Browser or Pixel) is a significant risk
		- Limiting the source of URLs to crawl based on ad ids is less of a risk (e.g. Ads landing page URLs)
	- Next steps
		- Josh says we likely need an MDS review - he will check w/ other PXFN leads and confirm 
	- Misc
		- Offline evaluation can be unblocked if limited to US users (but crawling itself may not be an "offline" action)
		- Catalog crawler is already problematic - crawling outside US especially EU; need to add mitigations similar to central GenAI crawler mitigations
- VO review
	- Meeting scheduling request
	- Hi XX, hope you're doing well! Could you please help schedule a meeting from Sagar's calendar for the following:
	- Subject: VO + SG Ranking Review
	- Date/time: 30 mins in the first week of December (preferably earlier in the week)
	- Attendees: please see screenshot and/or this bookmark link for the list of attendees: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d6TqOmI81-yfVE2C54__WH1dNUT09V04ZElFWjvUPMA/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.2pgs7mqpo723
	- Thanks very much in advance for your help!
- SEAR review w/ [[Fan Yuan]] [[Zhen Chen]] [[Yuhui Ouyang]]
	- Framing of global vs. segment level gains
		- Clarify that we are getting global gain, not just segment gain; trade-off may be a sensitive word; clarify that other segments will be neutral
		- Don't focus on product segments; e.g. framing as OC vs. App etc. would be problematic 
		- OC training is volume based on value based - focus on that
	- Be more specific on segments
		- User imbalance between countries
		- iOS vs Android
		- Blue app vs. IG
	- Be more specific on problems / solutions
		- ML training
		- Data imbalance
		- Early stage retrieval efficiency
		- Ranking model design for sparse learning
		- Jointly redesign total value framework w/ bidding
	- E.g. DPA
		- We've identified that DPA segment is worth focusing on; low pass-through rate from PM stage which indicates hypothesis
	- Fan: why is this in SGI? Sounds more like ranking side optimization
		- Fan: if there are data problems, this is relevant for SG; else it may be Ranking AI
		- If RAI focus - then it can be a ranking deep dive review
		- Or it's really relevant to data flywheel; not ready for a broad inform review
	- Sha: GAS goals in 2025 are very small compared to headroo
	- Marvin: two dimensions
		- Identifying high value segments
		- Then what else to do 
- 1-1 w [[Wei Wu]] - debrief from review
	- We are working on ranking + business co-design problem; all of them can be included
- [[AI Alliance]] community meet w/ [[Dave Nielsen]] [[Tim Bonnemann]] [[Yolande Poirier]]
	- Ok to go ahead for meetup
	- CA community college event
		- Dave is helping california community college faculty to discuss how to teach in the era of AI - 
		- probably in Feb - on a Friday at De Anza community college
		- unconference - no presentations - just discussions on topics 
		- Focus on 28 community colleges in SF Bay Area
		- Might expand further beyond that
