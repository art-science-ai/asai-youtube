## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[NoamSchachter]]
	- Intro Noam
		- Recently joined Jon Hickman's team as part of a merger
		- His team used to be ML infra team - used to own Product Recommender ML infra - but that moved to other teams
		- Now his team has MLEs + SWEs; MLEs do work similar to Hickman's team; SWEs can fund some of the infra work; one of their SWEs joined Hem's team
		- Currently focusing on Dynamic Ads - because they have context on Shops
- 1-1 [[Dare Obasanjo]]
	- Next week - Track 2 - w/ Fred
	- Two weeks out - Mon Leads
- VO review update
	- Main topics
		- There are two major motivations for roadmap changes since the last roadmap update in December 2024:
			- OBA policy change: The decision to merge OBA strict into OBA pragmatic significantly improves VO performance with a higher SL mitigation / recovery rate.
			- VO GTM in August: In preparation for VO’s planned GTM in August, we want to accelerate VO performance improvement efforts to meet this timeline.
		- In light of the above, we propose the below acceleration options for the roadmap and describe the risks.
	- Follow-ups
- Pixelcloud presentation
