Hi Vijay, since you're interested in learning a musical instrument, I wanted to suggest GeoShred to you. It's an iPad based virtual string instrument that you can use to play Carnatic music. I recently started playing around with it so I can share more info if you're interested! 

Check out this video for an example by Mahesh Raghvan - he's a Carnatic fusion musician who makes his music exclusively with GeoShred: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2sGpqipggw
