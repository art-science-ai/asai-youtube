## Today's notes
- Meet w/ [[Josh Gluck]] and [[Austin Mazella]]
	- Concerns from Josh
		- If only certain people in certain orgs should have access - we should keep it that way
		- No issues worthy of escalation
	- Austin follow-up
		- Contact Sheela on Ranking internal chatbot LAMA - we might need those same reqs
	- Next steps
		- Call it dogfooding - we don't need LLAMA
		- LAMA - after beta - may need for scaling
			- Borrow Sheela's chatbot LLAMA
		- People Privacy Review process - for internal folks - before beta - confirm if we need to do it
		- Austin will be legal counsel
		- Anne needs to bring in UXR legal counsel to deal with their specific issues
	- IAB LH issues
		- Austin was IAB legal for like 2 yrs - it's a mess
		- He never liked that we call it 1PD but we need to opt-in for it
		- Privacy position is that data becomes 1PD because the user agrees to opt-in - which doesn't make sense; logically it should be 1PD
		- Austin pushed for CPE to have LH URLs considered 1PD standard - Mohammad and Dare and Jaime signed off
		- Goal is to unlock Europe
		- Then he got moved out of IAB > Signals > Ranking
	- Related project - Sheela + Nate Ads LLAMA
		- They take UGC, ad interactions, etc. run through LLM and make vector embeddings and keyword databases
		- Work with them on 3PD opt-out usage for that stuff
		- Sequence
			- Foundational LAMA for ADS-LLAMA
			- Subsequent items will be built on that node
- Follow-up note: Advertiser Understanding AI Agent
	- Alpha testing / dogfooding with ~25 internal users with BPM studies
		- After consultation with MGenAI PXFN and BPM stakeholders, we determined that BPM studies can be used for this project as long as we scrub PII data
		- MGenAI PXFN also suggested that additional "Privacy Review for People Data" may be needed for usage of internal employee data - Nikhil + Austin to follow up
		- No need for any additional privacy review beyond the above
	- Expansion beyond alpha and inclusion of UXR studies
		- MGenAI privacy consult to determine if LAMA is needed based on scope of expansion beyond alpha
		- For UXR-specific issues UXR PXFN will need to weigh in on any additional requirements in consultation with MGenAI PXFN
