## Today's snippets
```txt
Hey Dave, Gautam - Marvin and I met with Li and Krishna today, and I wanted to share some updates here

*Li + Krishna's thoughts*
1. We need to get T2 + T4 leads together in a meeting to discuss the problem live to build consensus before aligning on a solution
2. There is no deadline for us to rush towards a solution, and we should prioritize building consensus on the right principles even if it takes more time
3. Rather than recommending a particular solution at this stage, let's just frame the problem and list several possible solutions incorporating POVs from both sides in a neutral manner

*Next steps for this week*
1. Marvin + Dave to help schedule a meeting mid-next week including T4 leads (Krishna, Li, Zhen) and T2 leads (Jerry, German) and the four of us
2. Gautam + I will work on a framing doc and share here by end of this week
