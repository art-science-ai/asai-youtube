## Today's notes
- PM Level Distribution 2025
	- Hi Chris — I chatted w/ Scott about contributing to your "PM Level Distribution" initiative this year and volunteered to help drive this process:
	- - Manage communication and follow-ups with HRBP to obtain the data in a timely manner
	- - Use the data to update charts + wiki + draft draft WP post
	- Eng recently updated their level distribution stats last month, and Jillian Vallerand from the People team is the one who provided the data. I wonder if it would be easier for the same person to pull the PM data as well?

- Gender reveal
	- Request to hide gender from NIPT results
	- Hi, I'd like to request the baby's gender be hidden from the NIPT results. When I requested this during my NIPT appointment today, they told me that I would have to contact the Ob/Gyn office for this request. Please let me know if there's anything else I need to do. Thank you!
