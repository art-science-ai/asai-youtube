## Today's notes
- [[Meta PM interview]] w/ [[Matthew Jay Simon]] - [[Netflix Podcasts PM]]
	- Intro
		- Personal intros
			- Cvent - event management technology
		- Interview flow
			- 3 interviews > analytical thinking > 4 components
			- Time management
			- Communication and sharing
			- 
	- Misc
		- Spent a long time on his intro going through his resume
	- Product rationale: 3:10 - 3:15
		- Notes
			- Scope: Focus on consumption vs. creation
			- Netflix wants to increase engagement; lot of competition among services vying for consumer attentions from sports to music
			- Podcast trend: shifting to video format
			- Content creators want to grow their reach
			- Users want to find more content to engage with
			- Creates opportunity for advertisers too
			- Mission summary: increase the amount of knowledge spread thru Netflix 
		- Eval: strong
			- + Great articulation of product rationale considering a wide range of stakeholders including competitors, creators, consumers, and advertisers
			- + Defined competition very broadly in terms of anything that consumes user attention
			- + Defined a clear mission statement (upon prompting): increase the amount of knowledge spread through Netflix
			- - Failed to refer back to mission statement in subsequent sections of the interview. Did not tie back metrics or goals to the stated mission of spreading knowledge
		- RS eval: strong
	- Metrics: 3:20 - 3:30
		- Notes
			- Creators
				- Number of podcasts on the platform that have a certain number of listeners; number of "legit" podcasts on the platform
				- Number of podcasts / episodes uploaded per week
					- Number of episodes uploaded per week
				- Weekly active users
			- Consumers
				- Podcasts / episodes played over threshold duration
				- % of listeners reaching threshold duration
				- Minutes on the platform
				- Number of unique podcasts
			- Ad metrics
				- Reach: impressions
				- Engagement: clicks
		- Eval: moderate
			- + Brainstormed a wide variety of metrics across different categories - consumer, creator, advertisers
			- - Failed to provide a clear organizational structure for the metrics provided; e.g. defining user journey would have provided a clear structure 
			- - Failed to define metrics rigorously even when prompted; e.g. is the total number of episodes per day / week / month?
		- RS eval: target audience identification was not strong; prioritization of engagement (vs. adoption) was not justified
	- Goals
		- Notes
			- Simple language goal: "Creating a healthy ecosystem of podcasts for our users"
			- Prioritize "engagement" as the key goal
			- Top 3 metrics
				- Number of episodes uploaded
				- Episodes viewed: podcast started and watched over x threshold
				- Minutes spent on the platform
		- Eval: moderate
			- + Defined a simple language goal: "Creating a healthy ecosystem of podcasts for our users"
			- - Failed to explicitly tie this goal to the metrics prioritized and failed to tie goal back to the mission
			- +/- Prioritized "engagement" as the key goal and selected top 3 metrics for this goal, but failed to provide justification and rationale for prioritization
		- RS eval: did not consider user journey and types of users (new vs. existing users)
	- Trade-offs: podcasts vs. tv shows and movies
		- Notes
			- Podcasts vs. movies may not necessarily be a bad thing
			- We want to consider impact to total daily usage across entire app (e.g. time spent)
		- Eval: moderate
			- + Discussed implications of the trade-off in a nuanced manner noting that podcasts vs. movies may not necessarily be a bad thing and suggested guardrail metrics (total time spent on platform)
			- - Failed to consider broader guardrails (e.g. revenue, subscriptions, etc.) and failed to define guardrails rigorously 
		- RS eval: I as interviewer did not spend enough time
	- RS feedback for me
		- Don't do intros - they take too much time; just intro self not others
		- Metrics and goals - lot of rambling - I started interjecting late - I should have interjected sooner
- [[Physical therapy]] [[sports medicine]] appointment w/ [[Stephen Chen]] on [[Tennis elbow]]
	- Causes
		- Inflammation - tendonitis
		- Wear and tear - tendonosis
		- Less likely - arthritis of joints
	- Treatments
		- Topical anti-inflammatory
			- OTC - voltarin
			- Heat / ice pack
			- Oral - ibuprofen or stronger version
		- Braces - wear all the time
			- Elbow brace
			- Wrist brace
		- Reduce or take a break from playing
		- Injection for inflammation - next level
	- Follow-up
		- Do above treatments
		- If no help, start with x-ray - wait 3-4 weeks
