	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- Slept late yesterday and didn't get a great sleep. Was caught up in this new programming project and got carried away, then my mind was too alert and I watched more YT videos before going to sleep. No worries, all good. That's already something I'm prioritizing and getting better at - bedtime routine. Had one bad day after a long streak of good days. Just keep calm and carry on! :)
		- Started some avoidance at work too. Messages starting to pile up and I'm ignoring them. Commit to a fresh start today! Falling behind on the podcast as well. Commit to doing those things today and focus on getting them done.
		- What else on my mind? Exercise is picking up. Going up in weights, added T3s to my lower days. Next milestone will be to add. Got slightly distracted adding things to my quarterly journal on exercise goals. No worries.
		- What else is on my mind? Who should I connect with today? Someone I haven't reached out to in a couple of weeks. Try Avi babai - it's his birthday!
