## Today's notes
- Note to Marvin
	- Hey Marvin, I'm unfortunately unable to come into the office today due to a conflicting doctor's appointment. I'll meet you guys directly at dinner tonight and then at tomorrow's offsite.
	- I'm rescheduling today's 1-1 to tomorrow, split into two parts: 9:30-10am and then 5-5:30pm. If that doesn't work, we can also move it to Thursday.
- [[AI Alliance]] Community steerco meet w/ [[Dave Nielsen]]
	- [[Anthony Annunziata]] - director representing open source at IBM - manager of Tim and Dave
	- [[Sean Hughes]] - director representing open source at ServiceNow 
	- Dave shared a pretty vague mission doc - agreed to some async follow-ups
- 1-1 [[David Furst]]
	- AI4P + Enablement
		- Rolling AI4P under enablement - RAI leads seem aligned on this, but some open questions
		- Should AI4P be a new LTT workstream or should it fall under existing workstreams? But it has a different iRev attribution model
		- Direct iRev that doesn't go to SGP
