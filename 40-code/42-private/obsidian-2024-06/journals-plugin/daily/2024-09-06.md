- [[Sparsh Hospice]] donation feedback
	- Compare Sparsh's donation webpage to the donation button on doctorswithoutborders.org to learn how you could improve:
	- ✅ Donation button featured prominently on Sparsh's homepage (but consider making it even more prominent by using a different color)
	- ❌ Multiple donation buttons on DWB 
	- ❌ One-time and monthly options are not on the same page
	- ❌ No pre-defined amounts for donations - this significantly decreases your donations
	- ❌ Confusing set of options to choose from - these options seem to serve no purpose and will significantly decrease the donation rate
	- ❌
