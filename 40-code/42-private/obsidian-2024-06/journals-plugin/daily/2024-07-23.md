	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- Had a good morning with exercise - lower body! I feel like I might be spinning my wheels with the squats. I've been doing the same thing - GZCLP nearly two years on and off and haven't made a ton of progress on squats. Maybe I need a different program? Counterpoint is that I've seldom done the full progression and resets. I've almost always had start stop blocks. Also I'm adding on a new component of GTG. So let me try that for at least a month before evaluating options. That means next time I'll probably go to 165 x 2, then 175 x 1. Then reset to 135 x 5. I think that will be good. I have a wider range of progress. One variable I keep changing ad-hoc is the progression. Am I doing 5lbs or 10lbs. I'm arbitrarily deciding. But instead I should set a rule for the cycle. Let me just set this right now. Say lower body is 10lbs all around and upper body 5lbs all around. This promotes faster resets. Let me make this change right now. Then later I can re-do it a different way and slow down progression if I feel needed. In GZCLP I should embrace the reset and not try to avoid it. That's possibly one mistake.

## Drafts
```txt
For the Signal Growth part my next step is to put together a small working group across SG + VO teams to identify key opportunities to drive iRev and work on an ROI analysis (including possibly some offline experimentation for validation). My understanding is that the goal is to come up with a concrete list of opportunities together with their iRev potential and HC requirements for the Napkin ask.

Hi, further to our PSML 2024-H1 summary post, we now have HBT attributed GAS results. 

For PSML areas that reported GAS / iRev wins, could you please refer to the H1'24 SG ML Ads Score Attribution doc [A] to identify which proposals correspond to your areas and add them to our PSML H1 summary doc [B]? Please include the "Launch Name" and the "proposal_name" at minimum. Thank you!
