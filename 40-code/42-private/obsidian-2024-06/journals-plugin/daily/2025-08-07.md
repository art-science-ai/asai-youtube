	- Hey, it was great meeting you at the AI Agent meetup this week. Following up on our conversation about exploring partnership opportunities with llama-stack, I'm connecting you with my colleague Rohith who'd be happy to discuss this with you further. Separately, if you're also interested in contributing to open source projects (including llama-stack) through the AI Alliance, please feel free to ping me separately to discuss that further. Looking forward to a potential collaboration! 😊
