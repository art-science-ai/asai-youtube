#### AI Advertiser Understanding Agent dogfooding update
[[Advertiser Inbound AI]]

We launched an [alpha release of the AI Advertiser Understanding Agent](https://fb.workplace.com/groups/1627950354443783/permalink/1718460618726089/) in December with a limited knowledge base of BPM-led Advertiser Understanding studies. We had ~50 users join our dogfooding group for testing and feedback over the past two months, and here is a quick summary of what we've found and what we're planning as next steps:

Key findings
1. Users find the chatbot helpful for some use cases (e.g. roadmapping, inbound gathering), but not for others (e.g. literature review) 
2. Users are not finding a reason to use the chatbot repeatedly (i.e. user adoption and retention is low)

Next steps
3. [ ] Shortlist upcoming advertiser inbounds for March / April: Victor Stossel
4. Draft product + eng plan: Nikhil Maddirala Lakhvinder Gaba
