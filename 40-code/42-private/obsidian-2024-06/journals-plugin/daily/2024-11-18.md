## Today's notes
- Advertiser AI meeting w/ [[Curtiss Cobb]] [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Sagar Pilania|Sagar Pilania]] [[Anne Kroeger]] [[Victor Stossel]]
	- Curtiss feedback
		- Loves the concept and it can be incredibly valuable; external research shows that AI agents can be almost as good as collecting new market research when topics are well studied; no problem with this overall
		- Want to follow protocols to ensure it's not harmful
	- Key issues
		- Privacy and legal risks and meeting external commitments
			- Data deletion
			- Research ops compliance
		- Evaluating accuracy of AI agent before launch; half-issue: point people to where to dig deeper
		- Longer term - expanding beyond mon BPM/UXR
	- Responses - Sagar
		- Long term expansion - totally part of the plan
		- Compliance - start with BPM, then expand to UXR with compliance
	- Responses - from Nikhil
		- INTERNAL use only
		- ACCURACY - links to sources
		- NOT used for training data
	- Conclusion
		- OK to start alpha for 25-30 users with only BPM excluding UXR
		- INPUT quality: study owner sign-off is okay
		- Output quality - hallucination - solve with standard AI evaluation
		- Output quality - synthesis - need SOME level of Human in the loop review for model iterations with test queries and % pass rate or similar; only required when UXR is included; BPM is fine - they can manage on their own
