## Today's notes
- Sync w [[Mustafa Jaber]] [[Praveen Sampath]] [[Shalin Sood]]
	- Risks
		- Public availability is low risk
			- Low risk for crawling of publicly available info
		- Existing agreements with advertisers causes risk
			- If we have agreement with advertiser about how we are using crawling data
		- Sensitive data
	- Use cases
		- E.g. autocat. If Nike runs static ads, we automatically create a product catalog for them. This is low risk.
		- But if we use it for ranking, it may be breach of contract
		- Ads side features is probably lower risk vs. user side features
	- Advertiser specific risks
		- Need to separate advertiser contracts into buckets and analyze by bucket
- Chrome Tab Groups: How to use them like Arc Folders?
	- One of the
	- Closing a tab 
- Data strategy w/ [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Marvin Kim|Marvin Kim]] and [[Fan Yuan]] [[Guang Li]]
	- Marvin: Zhen said there is a data demand strategy 
	- Fan: Data demand is Sagar's idea, but this is different
	- Fan: We are looking for new 3PD data
		- New early stage idea about intersection of data and ML
		- One outcome could be what data to acquire
	- Guang: create flywheel 
		- New data from advertisers
		- Demonstrate value using ML and trigger to get more value
	- How different from 1PD?
		- 1PD focus on mitigating SL
		- Here we want to focus on growth rather than mitigation
	- Example: Value Optimization
		- Ecomm advertisers send new data
		- Improving data quality for Value Optimization - need to create incentive for improving data
		- Can we provide specific guidance for how advertisers can improve data quality? E.g. normalizing currency or data formats
	- Examples
		- VO
		- CAPI
		- LeadGen
		- CrossPub

	- Q: Applications using data platform - behavioral
		- Online petition website where users could make petitions
		- Microservices
			- User microservice
			- Petition
			- Signature
		- User journey

			- Location service sees location of user and fetches relevant petitions
