## Today's notes
- Setting [[aerospace macos]]
- [[AI Alliance]] tools wg meeting
	- We went through all the repos in the main AIA readme under this section and caught up on unstructured status updates
	- Q: llama-stack demo app - do we have a designated maintainer and what's the best way for me to get involved with that?
	- Update to Amit
		- Hey, I joined today's AI Alliance meeting on "Focus Area: Agents, Applications, and Tools", where we reviewed all the projects under this focus area: https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance#focus-area-agents-applications-and-tools
		- One of the projects is a llama-stack demo app, which is just getting started. I've joined the working group of contributors to this project and can keep you posted on progress.
		- Separately, I'm also a contributor to one of the other projects in that list (Allycat), where I recently contributed a new RAG chatbot UI: https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/allycat/pull/17 I can also think about potential llama-stack integrations there.
		- 
		- Questions
			- Are we also looking for contributions to llama-stack (e.g. addressing issues), or just examples and demos to drive adoption?
