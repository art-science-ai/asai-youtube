	- Matt Krueger, Kristoffer Nelson, Ken, Jonathan, Praveen, Cindy
	- Hi XX, we are working towards an MDS review on the usage of web crawl data for ads personalization, and we're trying to identify the right stakeholders from Privacy for this review. Subodh Iyengar recommended that Matt or Kristoff would likely be the right POCs for this, so we were hoping you guys could take a look at this doc [A] and confirm who is the right Privacy POC? We're also happy to set up some time to discuss live and answer any questions you may have, thank you! 😊
