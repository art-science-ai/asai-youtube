	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- I've been off my routine for a few days now - almost a week. Also stopped tracking. Good day to get back into it now! Didn't exercise today, but can do in the evening - also playing pickleball so that's good. Good that I'm getting more into pickleball - I'm really enjoying that! It's a cool new hobby i'm getting into. Fun that I can do it both on VR as well as IRL. Haven't really started the VR version yet - but will do this week! Yay!
		- What about exercise / strength training / cardio? Mornings have been a bit rough these days due to sleep issues, though that is getting better now. Perhaps one thing is to push through the difficult morning and just do it anyway. At least I'll get a sense of how that's going. I think it's just starting trouble. The first 5-10 mins will feel rough but then I'll get into it. Especially if it's cardio or upper body day I shouuld be fine those are not even that taxing. If it's a lower body day I can just decide not to push the weight and instead hold. Not a bad idea.
		- What's going on at work? I feel I might be drowning a bit in all the projects I'm taking on. Need to make progress on them this week. What are some simle things I can knock out? Summit invites and genai update, web crawl update.
	- Connect: reach out to someone
		- It's been a while since I reached a few people - who today? I did reach out to Kamesh yesterday that was good. I can do the Whatsapp scroll thingy.
