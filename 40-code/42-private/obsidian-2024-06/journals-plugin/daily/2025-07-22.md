	- Hi all, I'm starting this AI4E-internal thread to share some updates on the upcoming AI4E review with Lars Backstrom on July 25
	- Context: FB is building their own AI4P Product Collaboration Team as part of the AI4P@FB initiative, and they recently hired the first set of 5-6 eng focusing on AI for Experimentation. More info here: https://fburl.com/workplace/jkmv2dbw 
	- Upcoming review: This is part of a monthly review series with Lars to review progress on AI4P@FB, and this week's review includes a deep-dive on Experimentation, which will be jointly presented by FB + CPP teams. The meeting invite is limited to the working group (me, Leo, Hongyu from CPP), but I'm sharing here for visibility to broader CPP stakeholders.
	- Review doc: Please take a look at the review doc and feel free to share your feedback with me, Hongyu, Leo: https://fburl.com/gdoc/syll1pne
