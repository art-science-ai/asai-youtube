Conference room availability for Thursday 11/14

Hi, I'm very sorry to bother you, but I just wanted to check on the status of your conference room booking:

DETAILS

We are looking for a conference room for our team offsite for ~20 people, and I just wanted to check in case you might have had any change of plans or last minute cancelation on your end which would make the conference room available for us? If not, no worries at all. Thanks very much in advance for your reply, and apologies once again for the trouble! 😊
