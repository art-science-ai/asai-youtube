## Today's notes
- [[Fan Yuan]] note
	- This diagram was originally made for DMF strategy in early 2024-H2 [A]. We used a similar diagram for 1PD strategy later in 2024-H2 [B] to emphasize similar feedback loop between 1PD data and ML. Now it looks like someone has repurposed [B] into a new strategy doc - I am tracking it down.
