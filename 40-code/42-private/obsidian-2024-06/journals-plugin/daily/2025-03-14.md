Note to Amit
```txt
Hey Amit, hope you're doing well! 😊 I'm a Product Manager in Monetization AI, and I've been active in the AI Alliance (AIA) community. Recently Dave Nielsen invited me to join a SteerCo for AIA, which I think he might have mentioned to you as well. I've noticed that nobody else from Meta seems active in AIA, and I was just wondering if you could help me learn more about current status of Meta's engagement with AIA and who are the key internal stakeholders? Thanks in advance!
