	- Outreach message
		- Hi, I'm organizing a happy hour for 20 - 25 people on Friday 1/10 at 6pm - 8pm. I'm looking for a venue with a semi-private space for us to meet up with some drinks and appetizers (no dinner). I have a budget of around $40 per person (including tax and tip), but people may additionally order at the bar and pay individually. Could you please let me know what options you have? Feel free to reply to this email or call/text me at 203-214-9055. Thank you!
