Hi, I'm interested in your upcoming course: MUS. 401 –  Voice I (CRN: 44802) at  College of San Mateo for Spring 2025. I was wondering if you could share a course syllabus to help me determine if this course is right for me? Thanks very much in advance!

Hi Prof. Bobrowski, I'm interested in your upcoming course: MUS. 280 –  History of Electronic Music (CRN: 48728) at  College of San Mateo for Spring 2025. I was wondering if you could share a course syllabus to help me determine if this course is right for me? Thanks very much in advance!

Also, I understand that this is an online course, but there seems to be no information about course timings - does that mean there are no fixed times?
