## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Ilya Mironov]]
	- AUC as technical debt
		- AUC is perfectly aligned w/ ML goals
		- ML doesn't care about tails - ML doesn't care about overfitting tails
		- epsilon cares about tails - but not AUC
	- 3p features
		- In this case AUC vs. ML features is a real trade-off
- 1-1 [[Dave Congdon]]
	- Intro Dave
		- Shops Ads - unlocking for new segments like subscriptions and omni
		- Conversion experiences incubation projects
		- New scope related to measurement and attribution on IAB
	- Aside: IAB measurement issues
		- Lot of leakage with clicks -> IAB conversions
		- Conversions not being reflected in advertiser tools - like CSA for Shops / IAB
	- Focus of 1P strategy
		- Value of more track 2 data beyond IAB
		- For new products - what value is there - how much product growth is needed to scale value; what types of data are most valuable; how do we tap that value
		- Product iRev vs. data use iRev - making the product better goes to the product, making ads in general better goes to ads data use irev
	- Opportunities beyond Track 2
		- Biz Msg, etc. - consider this lower priority but don't exclude 
	- My Qs
		- Need DS support
		- XFN stakeholders - core T2 stakeholders
- Call w [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/One Medical|One Medical]]
	- Prescription renewal
		- Last time you renewed my prescription only for one month, and you wanted me to check-in
	- Heart health measures
- [[Piano recital for MUS301 Piano I]]
