Music learning goals
- Learn how to play music 
	- Start with beginner songs (e.g. nursery rhymes) and gradually move up to very simple songs across multiple genres including Western + Carnatic
- Learn how to compose music
	- Start with a beginner song (e.g. a nursery rhyme with melody only) and compose increasingly complex versions of it (e.g. adding a baseline, adding chords and arpeggios, etc.); use music theory and AI to help with composition
