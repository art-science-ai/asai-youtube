- Intro
	- Hi, I'm Nikhil! My experience with music is like a "long time listener, first time caller". I started learning to play music about 6 months ago — I'm learning piano and a virtual iPad instrument called Geoshred. I'm also interested in music composition and production, which is why I want to learn music theory!
	- I'm interested in Classical, Jazz, Electronic, and Indian Classical music. My goal is to create fusion music that blends some of these genres together. One of my all time favorite albums is an Indian Classical + Jazz fusion album called "Kinsmen" by Rudresh Mahanthappa. I'm also inspired by MusicalBasics (Western Classical + Electronic fusion) and Mahesh Raghvan (Indian Classical + Western Pop fusion).
