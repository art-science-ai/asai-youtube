- Create new notebook
	- Colab > new notebook > rename
	- Edit in Colab
	- File > Save a copy as github gist
	- This saves a copy in github gist. Now we can safely delete the Drive version.
- Edit existing notebook
	- Github gists > open in colab (DO NOT directly open from Colab)
	- Edit in colab
	- File > Save (DO NOT select "save a copy")
- Renaming
	- Avoid renaming notebooks - new names don't sync w GH
