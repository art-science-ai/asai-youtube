# Introduction
This is my unofficial guide on preparing for Product Management (PM) interviews at Meta. Please also read Meta’s [official guide on Preparing for your Product Management Interview](https://www.metacareers.com/pm-prep-onsite/) from which I have borrowed much of this content. 

Since Meta follows a PM interview format that is widely adopted across the tech industry, preparing for Meta PM interviews provides a solid foundation for any other PM interviews you are preparing for. I recommend this guide as a starting point, and then layering on company-specific interview prep in addition to this — e.g. some companies also have interviews on "product strategy".


# Understanding the interview format
There are three types of PM interviews you will encounter at Meta:
1. **Product sense interview**: How you take an ambiguous idea and create a great product
2. **Analytical thinking interview**: How you identify and prioritize goals, and come up with the right set of metrics to measure success.
3. **Leadership and drive interview**: How you motivate a team, drive alignment, build relationships, and work with others.

The interview process will progress in two rounds or stages:
1. **First round**, a.k.a. initial screen: The first round consists of two interviews of 45 minutes each — Product Sense and Analytical Thinking. If you pass the first round, you will move on to the final round. The evaluation standards for the first round are the same as the final round, so it is not an “easier version” of the interviews.
2. **Final round**, a.k.a. full loop: The final round consists of three interviews of 45 minutes each — Product Sense, Analytical Thinking, and Leadership and Drive. If you pass the final round, you will be approved for an offer and move on to the team matching process.

# What Meta is looking for in PMs
The Product Sense and the Analytical Thinking interviews are business case studies that include hypothetical questions about Meta products (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc.) or non-Meta products. These interviews evaluate your core functional skills as a PM.

Here are the **4 key skills** you will be evaluated on in the Product Sense and Analytical Thinking interviews:
1. **Structure**: Meta is looking for PMs who can bring structure to open ended questions and answer them methodically. Make sure to use a framework of your choice to answer the questions methodically.
2. **Creativity and innovation**: Meta is looking for PMs who can consistently generate creative and unique ideas for any given problem. Examples include thinking of unique metrics in the Analytical Thinking interview, and generating creative solutions in the Product Sense interview. 
3. **Prioritization and evaluation of tradeoffs**: Meta is looking for PMs who can first lay out various options and then evaluate the pros and cons of each option to prioritize the right choice.
4. **User empathy and ability to think about different user segments**: Meta is looking for PMs who can identify and empathize with a broad range of user segments. For example, in the Product Sense interview you will need to identify various user segments and then put yourself in the shoes of a user to deeply understand their needs and challenges.

For all of your conversations, it’s good practice to step back and talk through why a problem matters before jumping into brainstorming and prioritizing specific ideas.

# Product sense interview
The Product Sense interview focuses on evaluating how you take an ambiguous idea and create a great product. In addition to setting the vision for their teams and describing the most important problems to solve, Meta Product Managers often will roll up their sleeves and work with their teams to identify and articulate ways to improve our products for the people who use them. This interview is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your product knowledge, creativity, and problem solving skills.

Here are the **4 key focus areas** you will be evaluated on in the Product Sense interview:
1. **WHY are we building this product?** Understanding the product landscape and motivation
2. **WHO are we building this for?** Determining the target audience
3. **WHAT problem are we solving?** Identifying and prioritizing the problem
4. **HOW are we solving the problem?** Developing creative and impactful solutions while making intentional design choices

The simplest way to demonstrate the key skills Meta is looking for (structure, creativity, prioritization, and user empathy) is to use a structured framework that guides you through each of the focus areas to brainstorm and prioritize ideas for each area. Check out my Analytical Thinking interview deep dive for more on this.

# Analytical thinking interview
The Analytical thinking interview focuses on evaluating how you identify and prioritize goals, and come up with the right set of metrics to measure success. Meta is a deeply data-driven company with more than 3 billion users across our family of apps, and we expect our product managers to be able to leverage data and logic to inform decisions. This interview is an opportunity for your to demonstrate you critical thinking skills to create logical structures, goals, and metrics to help guide decisions.

Here are the **4 key focus areas** you will be evaluated on in the Product Sense interview:
1. **Articulating a product’s rationale**: What's the purpose of this product for our company and our stakeholders?
2. **Setting reasonable, measurable and prioritized goals**: What are the key goals that enable us to realize our purpose?
3. **Measuring impact and identifying metrics**: What can we measure and monitor to understand our success or failure for our goals?
4. **Evaluating trade-offs**: How do we use data and logic to make difficult decisions and trade-offs?

The simplest way to demonstrate the key skills Meta is looking for (structure, creativity, prioritization, and user empathy) is to use a structured framework that guides you through each of the focus areas to brainstorm and prioritize ideas for each area. Check out my Analytical Thinking interview deep dive for more on this.

# Leadership and Drive interview
The Leadership and Drive interview focuses on evaluating how you motivate a team, drive alignment, build relationships, and work with others. While the Product Sense and Analytical Thinking interviews use hypothetical cases, the Leadership & Drive interview focuses on behavioral interview questions using your past experiences.

Here are the **4 key focus areas** you will be evaluated on in the Leadership and Drive interview:
1. **Driving resourcefulness and results**: For example, "tell me about a time when you had to deliver a project with limited resources?"
2. **Seeking opportunities to grow and learn**: For example, "tell me about a time when you received difficult feedback from your manager?"
3. **Taking ownership and accountability**: For example, "tell me about a time when your project failed?"
4. **Resolving conflict**: For example, "tell me about a time when you had a significant disagreement with one of your key stakeholders?"

The simplest way to prepare for behavioral interviews is to outline your interview stories using a version of the CAR: Context-Action-Result framework, and practice telling your stories in an engaging manner while adapting them to various questions. Check out my Leadership and Drive interview deep dive for more on this.


# Conclusion
Here are the topics we covered in this article:
- Understanding the interview format and process
- Understanding the key skills Meta is looking for in PMs and how to demonstrate those skills
- Understanding the purpose and key focus areas for each of the three interview types: Product Sense, Analytical Thinking, and Leadership and Drive

Here are some topics that were not covered in this guide, but may be relevant to you:
- Interviewing for PM leadership roles: This guide is applicable for L4 - L6 Individual Contributor (IC) PM roles at Meta. Senior leadership roles have a different interview process, which is beyond the scope of this guide (and my knowledge).
- Team matching and leveling: At Meta, the interview process is separate from the leveling and team matching process. This guide only focuses on the interview process.
- Deep dive into each interview type. I have separate articles on each interview type.
