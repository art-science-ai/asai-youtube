I’m trying to align code blocks inside nested bullets, and [I tried the solution here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/correct-way-to-align-code-block-inside-a-list-item/50855/), but my result is not matching the expected result shown in the solution. My result (see screenshot) creates code blocks where the code itself is indented. Thanks in advance for any help on this!
