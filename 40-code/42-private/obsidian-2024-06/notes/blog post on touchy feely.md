Learning to improve interpersonal relationships has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences in both my personal and professional life in recent years, and I wanted to share some reflections and resources to help other people along this journey.

For most of my life, I prioritized logic over emotions, believing that rational thinking was the key to success in both personal and professional relationships. But I’ve since learned that the deepest connections aren’t built on intellect alone. 

What stood out most in my ~50 hours of T-group experiences was the deep emotional connections that I was able to build with groups of strangers in such a short time span. Nurturing this emotional connection through vulnerability and openness has become something that I deeply value, and I consider it to be one of life’s most profound joys.
