Here is a detailed 12-week plan for applying to Product Manager jobs. This plan assumes you can dedicate roughly 10 hours per week to your Product Manager job search over the next 12 weeks. Feel free to scale up or down depending on your other commitments and how much time you can dedicate.  

### Phase 1: Getting started (week 1)
Spend the first week familiarizing yourself with the process, creating your application strategy, and setting up systems like job alerts.

1. **Read intro materials**: Read introductory book (e.g. Cracking the PM Interview) or online course on PM interview prep and make notes
	1. Timeline: Week 1
	2. Duration: ~4 hours
2. **Write your application strategy**: Start by defining your long-term goal, i.e. what is your desired skip-level role (next-to-next role), then work backwards to define your desired next role. Define your target roles, companies, industries, salary and level expectations, etc. 
	1. Timeline: Week 1 
	2. Duration: ~2 hours
3. **Prepare application and interview support materials**: Set up systems, processes, and templates for job alerts, application tracking, networking emails, application form filling, etc.
	1. Timeline: Week 1
	2. Duration: ~2 hours

### Phase 2: Preparing your materials (weeks 2 - 4)
1. **Craft your Resume + Linkedin profile**: Craft your Resume and Linkedin profile tailored to your goals
	1. Timeline: Week 2
	2. Duration: ~4 hours
2. **Prepare your behavioral interview stories**: Prepare 5-10 behavioral interview stories using the Context - Action - Result framework with bullet point outlines
	1. Timeline: Week 2
	2. Duration: ~4 hours
3. **Prepare your interview frameworks**: Create interview frameworks for various interview formats (product sense, analytical thinking, system design, etc.), interview question banks (e.g. tryexponent), and pipeline for mock interviews (e.g. Lewis Lin community)
	1. Timeline: Week 3
	2. Duration: ~3 hours
4. **Craft your work product (optional)**: Create (or refine existing) work product to showcase your skills. Examples: AI coding project on Github, design project on Figma, etc. This is especially useful when you are first breaking into Product Management or switching to a new area (e.g. AI) and you need to prove your competence.
	1. Timeline: Weeks 1 - 4 
	2. Duration: ~10 hours (~2.5 weeks per hour over 4 weeks)

### Phase 3: Putting it all together: applying and interviewing (weeks 3 - 12)
1. **Submit applications**: Review new job alerts and submit applications 2-3 times per week via online applications and referrals
	1. Timeline: Weeks 3-10 
	2. Duration: ~16 hours (~2 hours per week)
2. **Networking**: Networking outreach, follow-ups, and calls with people in your target companies and roles
	1. Timeline: Weeks 3-10 
	2. Duration: ~16 hours (~2 hours per week) 
3. **Interview practice**: Mix of individual practice (ideally with a video recording app) and mock interviews; update your interview frameworks and behavioral interview stories after each prep session
	1. Timeline: Weeks 3-11
	2. Duration:  ~36 hours (~4 hours per week)
4. **Live job interviews**: Recruiter calls, company-specific preparation, screening interviews, on-site interviews, follow-ups, etc.
	1. Timeline: Weeks 5 - 12
	2. Duration: ~16 hours (~2 hours per week)
