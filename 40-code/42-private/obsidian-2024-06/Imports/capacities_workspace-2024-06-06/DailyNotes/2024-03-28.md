            - Cohort strict K - I can only be associated with 1 cohort at inference time. Training time is still unclear. But how to test different cohorts to find the best cohort for the user? Hotswitch is one option, but causes SEVs and instability.

    - I can step back a little bit for the moment and come back later when we have more clarity

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Marvin Kim]]

    - Work w Yuhui on strategy and maybe relieve Zhirong and Wenhan

    - Can DS help us investigating and sizing the data

    - Have one option that hits the anonymization bar and is the most iRev
