    - Maxime message

        Hey, thanks for iterating on the doc! I noticed that you removed all references to OBA + unattributed, including the early steer goal as well as all the problem space overview and PXFN landscape sections.

        I was hoping to present an overview of the overall problem space and PXFN landscape as context, and call out that we have a technical solution for one part of the problem space (ATT Attributed) while the remaining problem space (OBA + Unattributed) is still going through technical review and alignment. Since unattributed is main the topic of this review series, leads will likely expect us to address this broader context.

        If you don't mind, I'd like to cover this briefly before diving into the ATT Attributed technical solution. This way, we provide the necessary context while still highlighting our progress.
