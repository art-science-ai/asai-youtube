        - Elijah at Meta for 3 yrs on PM recruiting; started on Reality Labs hardware, but also works across domains and products

    - PM hiring

        - No more generalist hiring - only allocated hires now

        - But recruiters often do have a generalist approach if they are confident in finding team match later

    - Referrals

        - Referral team is outsourced and don't have a good understanding of what we're looking for; new team is very black and white about the requirements - PM 

        - Suggest giving Elijah a heads up before referring candidates - he can get them through initial round

    - What kind of experience is PM adjacent

        - Consulting - title may say consultant, but can show in the job responsibilities, we may map 1-1 w PM experience; some experiences will count for 0.5 like PMM, Data Science, etc.
