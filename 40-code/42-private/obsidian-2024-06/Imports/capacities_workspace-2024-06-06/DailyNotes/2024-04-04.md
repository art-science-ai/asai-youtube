        Nice to hear from you, Jim — hope things are going well for you in London! I was very lucky to join Meta at the right time, and I'm doing very well, thanks! 

        Unfortunately I never worked directly with Nirmal Mani. I would recommend reaching out to Ashok Poothiyot and/or Pari Sawant — I believe they both worked with him directly.

        A1 = Accessory day 1 (home gym, Monday)

        B1 = Weightlifting day 1 (weightlifting gym, Tuesday)

        A2 = Accessory day 2 (home gym, Wednesday)

        B2 = Weightlifting day 2 (weightlifting gym, Thursday)

        - Inference is too broad covers things you want to do when training
