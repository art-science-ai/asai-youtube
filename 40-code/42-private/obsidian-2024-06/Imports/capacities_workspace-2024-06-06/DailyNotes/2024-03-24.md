    - Poker night at Nikhil's 3/23

        - Hey guys! I added you all to a splitwise group to coordinate the settlement from last night. Instructions:
        
        - Add an expense for your total buy-in (e.g. "Nikhil's buy-in", $150) with yourself as the payer and split with NOBODY else
        
        - Add an expense for your total cash-out (e.g. "Nikhil's cash-out", $70.25) with yourself as the payer and split with EVERYBODY except yourself
