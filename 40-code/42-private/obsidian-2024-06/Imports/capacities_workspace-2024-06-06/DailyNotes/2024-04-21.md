    - NYC office message

        - Hey, I'm visiting the NYC-50 office this week Tuesday (today), Wednesday, and Thursday, and would love to catch up in person if you'll be in office any of those days, thank you! 😊

        - Hey German, how's it going? I know it's been a long time since we worked together on 1PD platform, but I'm visiting NYC-50 office this week (Tuesday - Thursday), and wanted to request some time for a quick sync with you. I'm the PM on CoreML side responsible for Shops Ads collaboration opportunities (both pre-click and post-click), and would love to get your perspective on that. Thanks in advance for your time! 😊 
        
        

- Misc

    - Unwind feedback

        - 

        - Apple watch app: clicking the top left button (hamburger) or top right button ("i") doesn't do anything.

        - Starter exercises are not well designed. I usually want my sessions to be in a round number of minutes like 1m, 2m, 5m, etc.

        - So the free version is regressed  

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Marvin Kim]]

    - Sprinting on MDS new doc

    - Feedback from Kash

        - Don't be so combative with PXFN - communication style

        - Be more sensitive to senior TL disagreements

    - Feedback from Nitin/Marvin

        - Let's move faster - converge to the doc we need

        -

    - TODOs

        - Add flow diagram and toy examples

        - Sizing for options 3 and 4

- Strict K mitigation meet w [[../Pages/Shuai]] [[../Pages/Maxime Boucher]] [[../Pages/Brett Pailet]]

    - AN dependencies

        - Brett says "ATT principles" work was paused until Audience Netowrk work which is higher value than ATT features.

        - AN does not surface any ads to ATT-out users; there is a technical proposal for this

            - Cohort based ads - serving ads

            - Intermediate state proposal - get bid request from candy crush, resolve that to user, then fetch ads based on 1pd only model, send response to candy crush, then they send us ads request

        - Pausing other implementation decisions until that is resolved, because we may create new ATT principles based on this; can proceed with high level decisions like unattributed; timeline is this week for Hegeman discussion

        - ATT may be moving to OBA pragmatic standards

        - Minghao is lead on this

    - ATT strict-k discussion

        - Commitment: "we know longer know it's yours"

        - Apple Risk - not a concern

        - Regulatory risk 

            - Cross cohort re-identifiability attack to know the data is yours

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Maxime Boucher]]

    - Options are not clear and we are super worried

    - Ingestion time cohort - based on 1PD only

    - Serving time cohorts are based on 3PD

    - Cohort assigned before conversion event vs. after conversion event
