    - Focus: Semantic Ranking strategy

        Goal: update project doc

    - ATOM v SR

        We can discuss further in our 1-1 today, 

        The relationship is like this:

        - AI4Ads is working on Ads Transformer with cOntent Modeling (ATOM) which seeks to leverage content data from image, text, videos. [A]
        
        - Semantic Ranking seeks to solve Signal Growth specific problems and is relying on ATOM as one of the key technical building blocks. We are improving  upon ATOM with SG specific scenarios and building on top of ATOM.
