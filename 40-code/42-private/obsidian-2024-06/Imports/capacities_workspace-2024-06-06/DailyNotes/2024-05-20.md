    - [[../Pages/55 W 5th]] lease reply



        Hi Equity lease team,
        
        Thank you for sharing your lease renewal offer! We've loved living here for the past year, and would love to continue long-term. However, the proposed annual rent increase of over 7% quite steep for us. I'd appreciate it if you could consider some alternative proposals:
        
        **(1) Offer a longer lease duration** of 2 or 3 years instead of 1 year, which would incentivize longer term stay with stable, low-risk tenants!
        
        **(2) Offer a moderate annual rent increase** of 2 - 4%, which is more in line with typical rent increases and income growth in the area
        
        **(3) Offer a discount similar to our first year** (e.g. 1.5 months rent), which would help offset the cost of the steep rent increase
        
        While we love living here, the increased rent is very high relative to market and income growth rates. Additionally, there are several quality issues with the apartment that make it hard to justify the increase. For example, several aspects don't meet modern apartment codes (e.g. lack of exhaust fan in bathrooms, balcony guardrails over 4 inches apart, etc.) and the construction quality is below par for a luxury apartment (e.g. we've had to raise 40+ service requests this year for windows, doors, blinds, etc.).
        
        I believe these proposals could be mutually beneficial for us. You could avoid having the apartment vacant for long periods while finding new tenants (which I believe was a challenge last year).
        
        I understand that the deadline is May 22, and I'm sorry about the delayed response on my end (we were traveling for the past few weeks). Would it be possible to extend the deadline by a few days and/or connect me to the right person to discuss this with in the next 1-2 days? 
        
        
        Thank you!

    - Intro

        - Currently wwns a trucking company - logistics

        - Previously SWE at big tech including Twitter - mobile dev

    - Goal

        - Take snippets of code and transfer into web based software that can host everything under one roof

        - Rather than using hardcoded solutions, wants to use some AI; e.g. traveling salesman problem

    - Software needs; 

        - 100s of loads, shippers, and trucks

        - multiple trucks, multiple shippers, multiple loads to deliver

        - Current market offerings

            - PC Miler - from 1980s; only works with specific partners

            - Existing software locks you in to their ecosystem and partners

    - Contract effort

        - Tried contracting a small tech team to solve this problem, but it was challenging to coordinate 

        - Needed a TPM or manager to translate high level requirements to low level details

        - Then stopped development for 4-5 months; their company is growing and really needs this software

    - Basic module: dispatch module

        - Track status of trucks - loaded vs. unloaded, next stop, ETA, delays

        - Notifications to brokers, shippers

        - Matching drivers to loads and locations - currently inefficient

    - Biggest challenges
