        Seeking a short-term mentor for my GenAI side project (1-2 hrs per week)
        
        I'm and Ads AI product manager working on a side-project to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using MetaGen [1], and I'm looking for an engineering collaborator or mentor to help me with some n00b questions.
        
        My goal is to build a chatbot with a knowledge base of documents about a particular topic (e.g. an internal project), so that users (e.g. XFN stakeholders) can interact with the chatbot to ask questions and learn more about the topic. It's primarily for my own learning, but might also lead to something useful for others!
        
        I'm happy to do all the work myself, but I'm looking for a mentor who can spend 1-2 hours per week for the next 2-4 weeks to provide guidance and feedback via chat and occasional calls. I promise to be mindful of your limited time commitment! Please let me know in the comments if this is something you're interested in, and thanks in advance for your consideration! 😊

    - Outreach - oncall

        Hey could I ask you for a small favor? I'm working on a GenAI side project just for my own learning, and I need a volunteer to join my test oncall [1], because one of the tools I'm trying to use [2] needs a minimum two-person oncall.
