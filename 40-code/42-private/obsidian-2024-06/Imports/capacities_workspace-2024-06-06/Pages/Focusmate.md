## Review
As a Product Manager I have to attend a lot of meetings every day, so I live by my calendar. Outside meetings there's also a lot of asynchronous collaboration I need to keep up with via email, chat, etc. which can eat up all the free time on my calendar. This leaves very little time for focused work, which is very important for my long term goals and success.

I tried many approaches to solve this such as using todo lists and time-blocking (these approaches were ineffective for me) and even hiring productivity coaches (this approach was effective but expensive). Focusmate was an ideal solution for me: an effective and inexpensive way to fill empty slots on my calendar with focus blocks that I'll actually stick to. I highly recommend trying Focusmate for anyone who wants to be more productive in their professional or personal life.

## What I don't love about focusmate
- **Better calendar integration**: 
	- **Problem**: When I book a Focusmate session I get an email from Focusmate with an attached calendar invite. I need to take extra steps to open the attachment and add it to my calendar.
	- **Solution**: Send Focusmate events directly as a calendar invite which will directly add to my calendar.
- **Scheduling directly from calendar**:
	- **Problem**: My day is organized by my calendar. I need to open my calendar to find open slots for focus blocks, then open Focusmate and book slots for the corresponding slots.
	- **Solution**: Enable Focusmate bookings directly from my calendar. 
- **Start meetings 5 mins late**: 
	- **Problem**: I'm unable to schedule focusmate sessions immediately after work meetings (e.g. work meeting 1:30-2pm, focusmate 2-3pm), because my work meetings often end 1-2 mins late. 
	- **Solution**: I would love to be able to start focsumate sessions 5 mins after the hour (e.g. start at 2:05pm instead of 2pm). I recently [submitted the same feedback to Calendly](https://community.calendly.com/how-do-i-40/i-wish-calendly-had-a-start-meetings-5-mins-after-the-hour-feature-like-outlook-1543) as well.
