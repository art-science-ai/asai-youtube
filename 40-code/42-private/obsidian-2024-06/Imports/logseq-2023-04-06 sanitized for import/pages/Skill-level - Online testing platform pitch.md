	 - Background and challenges
		 - Context - world is changing
			 - Educators
				 - Education moving online; need for digital transformation; most educators are doing a "lift and shift"

				 - Unbundling of education - teaching vs. research vs. credential

			 - Employer
				 - Work and interviewing is moving remote - round 1 coding challenges

				 - Need to attract non-traditional talent

				 - Proliferation of nontraditional educators - difficult to evaluate the quality

			 - Covid - accelerated these trends

		 - Current challenges
			 - Educators
				 - Digital transformation: Need to move their assessment systems online / Very expensive for them to do it on their own / come up with homegrown solutions (MCIT anecdote)

				 - Improving UX of digital transformation (e.g. ProctorU)

				 - Keep up with relevant skills; teaching students to the market

				 - Lack of data sharing will keep it silod / can't benefit from the shared platform of data (what kinds of questions are more indicative of success, etc.)

			 - Employers
				 - Digital transformation of interview platforms

				 - Evaluating the quality of online educational programs

				 - Spend a lot of time on screening and selection

				 - Don't know if their signals are the right indicators of success 

				 - Access to nontraditional talent

		 - Example - CIT 593 midterm
			 - Screenshots - CIT 593 final - word doc formatting / code snippets in word 

			 - Word document - poor UX

			 - No data being collected

			 - No feedback on which types of questions students are struggling with vs. which ones do well

		 - Customer research
			 - Students
				 - "testing should more closely reflect the real world"

				 - "exam is an antiquated notion"

				 - "interview style exam"

			 - Univ
