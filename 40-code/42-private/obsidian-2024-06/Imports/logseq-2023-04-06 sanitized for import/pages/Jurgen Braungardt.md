	 - Therapy meeting !(2020-07-13)
		 - Freewrite prompts
			 - Internalized conflict; try to map it out externally

			 - Why do I have a hard time expressing my feelings? How come no one taught me this or how come this didn't come up.

		 - Agenda
			 - Tools to explore emotions: journaling

	 - Therapy with Jurgen !(2020-06-29)
		 - Notes
			 - Control issues are driven by trust and loneliness. I have problems placing trust in other people.

			 - I can recognize satisfaction and frustration at a gross level. But the subtle ones are difficult.

			 - I am downregulating my emotions all the time; developing a sense of distance to my self and to others. Gives me a sense of power or a sense of control. Driven by a fear of losing control.

			 - Remedy: try to make jokes and use humor to lighten the mood.

			 - To do: come up with a list of ideas. Work with Rukma on this. Take some risks to express emotions and let them come out more.

		 - Agenda
			 - Cancel for next week

			 - Moving in - organizing stress / trade-offs

		 - Notes
			 - Investigate in the coming week
				 - Where do my standards / perfectionism coe from? Parents / family / culture. How did I learn?

				 - Spectrum from work to play: where do I stand?

				 - Ultimate goals in life?

		 - Agenda

- Issues
	 - Resistance / guilt
		 - Resistance to taking on new projects.

		 - Continual feeling of guilt around setting goals and not achieving the goals.

		 - This leads to a vicious cycle where the guilt makes me not want to engage with the goal / project, leading to more guilt.

		 - I have a lot of resistance to getting back to Things. Miss meditation for few days and then I get a lot of guilt and resistance. Don’t come back. I’m too hung up on perfection. If something is not perfect I abandon it.

		 - After I miss meditation for a few days I start telling myself that I’m useless and I’m the kind of person who doesn’t meditate.

	 - Control issues / OCD
		 - I'm very controlling. I get quite uncomfortable if things are not conforming to an exact plan / list.

		 - Plays up in our relationship.

	 - Indecisiveness / overthinking
		 - Unable to make small decisions. Keep putting them off.
