- TODO How do I get a job as a product manager? [[Product Management]]  #[[Projects]]-EC-Writing
	- Introduction
		- I get a lot of outreach on Linkedin from students and young professionals asking for advice on how to get their first job as a product manager, and I've created this post as a guide for such people.
	- Stages in the PM process
		- Funnel diagram with arrows showing the stages and success
			- Submit resume / job application - 1000x
			- Get invited to interview - 10x
			- Get job offer - x
		- There are two key stages
			- Stage 1: Get invited to interview
			- Stage 2: Get a job offer
		- How difficult is each stage?
			- Depending on where you are in your career
	- Stage 1
		- If you are applying for your first PM job, this is the most difficult stage. My guess is that 99% of candidates fail at this stage.
		- What can you do to improve here?
			- Get relevant experience
				- Two types of experience are relevant here
					- PM experience
					- Subject matter experience
			- Improve your resume and Linkedin profile
			- Get into a PM hiring pipeline
				- MBA
				-
			- Get referrals
		- Lessons
			- Getting your first PM job is the hardest
			- With each subsequent PM
	- Stage 2
		- This stage is relatively easier.
		- How to improve
			- Understand the PM interview structure
			- Develop your own structured framework for answering each type of question
			- Practice, practice, practice
				- Individual practice
				- Practice forums on Slack
				- Reach out to people you know at target companies
		- Personally I went through the experience three times
			- 2019 - MBA > Adobe
			- 2021 - Adobe > Adobe
			- 2022 - Adobe > Facebook
