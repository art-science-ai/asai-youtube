title: Adobe Mentorship
---

- Background and challenges
	 - MBAs@Adobe is great at facilitating networking for small groups (e.g. Community Conversations) and large groups (e.g. Happy Hour), but is not so great at facilitating 1-1 networking and conversations.

	 - WFH has furthered the need for meaningful 1-1 connections within the community.

- Vision
	 - Enable meaningful 1-1 connections and conversations; build professional relationships and friendships

- Proposed approach(es)
	 - Watercooler conversations / coffee chats approach: randomly pair up participants 1x / week for coffee chats

	 - Structured networking approach: pair up participants intentionally (based on career goals, interests, etc.) and provide conversation guide

- Next steps
	 - Pilot program in partnership with MBAs@Adobe?
