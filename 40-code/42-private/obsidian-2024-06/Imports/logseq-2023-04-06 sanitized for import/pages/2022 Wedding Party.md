- Vows
	 - OG
		 - Rukma - Since we moved in together at the beginning of this year, we've spent almost almost every minute of every day together, and I still can't get enough of you.

		 - We wake up right next to each other, we work right next to each other, we eat together, we play together, and we do literally everything together. This is what I want for the rest of my life.

		 - It's usually pretty hard for me to feel certain about things like this - and you know this - but I know for sure that this is what I want.

		 - I've loved you so much, I love you now, and I promise to always love you and to be with you no matter what.

	 - Addendum
		 - It's now two years later, and I feel the same exact way I did when back then. We STILL spend almost every minute of every day together, and I STILL can't get enough of you.

		 - I've also grown so much

		 - I'm so happy that I'm spending the rest of my life with you!
