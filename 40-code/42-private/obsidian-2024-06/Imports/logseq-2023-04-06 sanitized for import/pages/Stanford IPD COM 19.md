	 - Reflection
		 - 1. Are there parts of yourself/behaviors that you tend not to show (such as expressing anger, showing you care, asking for help, etc.)?
			 - I struggle with expressing my emotions (except with Rukma). Showing care, frustration, and anger are difficult for me.

		 - 2. Are there specific aspects of your behavior you want to know how others react to; where you wonder how you are seen?
			 - I'm generally curious to know how I'm seen

		 - 3. Are there ways in which your relationships, both at work and in your personal life, are not fully satisfying to you, in particular, your ability to maintain and build them?
			 - Yes, at work I struggle to build personal empathetic relationships that go beyond the tasks at hand.

			 - In my personal life, my struggle is more about how to maintain and keep in touch with my relationships.

		 - 4. After reading Goleman’s “What Makes a Leader,” note the emotional intelligence competencies that you want to improve. Use the checklist on the following page to help with that.

		 - 5. Please talk to 2-3 colleagues, friends, family, or perhaps, your partner. Ask each of them what they would like to see you work on in this learning experience that could both strengthen your interpersonal relationships and build your interpersonal skills. Summarize their responses and your reactions to what they suggest. You can use the attached list of Emotional Intelligence Competencies and ask them to choose the top 3 to 5 competencies they would recommend you improve upon to become more effective in your interpersonal relationships.
			 - I'm attending a leadership skills workshop at Stanford this weekend, and one of my assignments is to ask people which of the attached skills they think I should work on. Would appreciate any input if you can spend 2 mins on this (but no pressure at all). Thanks in advance! 😄
