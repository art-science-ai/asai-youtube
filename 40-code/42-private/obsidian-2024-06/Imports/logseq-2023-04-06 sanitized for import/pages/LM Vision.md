- Jobs to be done
	 - I want to read my documents in a mobile-friendly layout (LM - already done).

	 - I want to read my documents in a format that is optimized for my personal readability (the ideal font, color, spacing, etc.)

	 - I want to extract and visualize the data in my documents.

	 - I want to extract relevant information from my documents (document summary, answers to questions)

	 - I want to find the sections of this document that are of interest to other users (popular highlights)

	 - I want to find other documents related to this document

	 - I want to extract the relevant next actions from my documents and create tasks or reminders (e.g. pay bill, read highlighted citations)
