		- Project Ramayana
			- Podcast
				- Share podcast idea w/ piyush group
			- Notes
				- Pocast
					- Valmiki's Ramayana is divided into 7 books / ~500 sargas / ~24000 slokas.
					- My idea for the podcast was to discuss approximately 1-5 sargas per episode (which means the podcast would have 100 - 500 episodes). The podcast should start with a 5 - 10 minute plot summary of the sarga(s) followed by a group discussion.
					- In fact I made a recording of the summary section of the first episode.
				- Online resource
					- Example: E.g. http://lotrproject.com/map
					- Goal: Key or guide to help people navigate the work; Maps, timelines, website, characters, etc.
