- Recruiting - questions I have
	 - Career progress
		 - What exactly is the "principal" level - almost all a16z employees on Linkedin have the title "partner"

		 - What does it take to get to GP level?

	 - What's a typical day in the life of a principal? Hours and wlb?

	 - Remote vs. in-office vs. travel split?
