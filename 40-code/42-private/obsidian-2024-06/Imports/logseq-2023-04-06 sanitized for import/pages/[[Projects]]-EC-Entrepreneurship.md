- List of my business ideas
	 - My Donation Portfolio
		 - Idea name
			 - My Donation Portfolio

		 - Idea in brief
			 - Users log into My Donation Portfolio to create customized donation portfolios featuring a list of their selected beneficiaries and a percentage allocation of funds for each beneficiary.

			 - Each user gets a personalized link (e.g. [www.MyDonationPortfolio.com/JohnSmith](http://www.mydonationportfolio.com/JohnSmith)) which they can share with friends and family on gift-giving occasions (birthdays, Christmas, etc.), featuring a large "donate on behalf of John Smith" button.

			 - Additionally, the user can also set up a recurring monthly / quarterly / yearly donation from his/her own bank account.

			 - All donations are automatically channeled to the beneficiaries as per the user's predefined allocation percentages.

		 - The problem
			 - Problem 1: There are a lot of organizations to which I want to donate a share of my income, but I don't have any system to do this. I consume a lot of media (websites, podcasts, blogs, etc.) from a variety of nonprofit sources (Wikipedia, NPR, etc.) which I would like to support and there are a lot of charities working on causes which I would like to support (e.g. UNICEF).

			 - Problem 2: Every year on certain special occasions (my birthday, Christmas, etc.), my friends and family want to give me gifts in kind or cash, but these are often unnecessary and wasteful. People are increasingly using charity donations as an alternative to personal gift giving.

		 - The solution
			 - Users log into My Donation Portfolio to create customized donation portfolios featuring a list of their selected beneficiaries and a percentage allocation of funds for each beneficiary.

			 - Each user gets a personalized link (e.g. [www.MyDonationPortfolio.com/JohnSmith](http://www.mydonationportfolio.com/JohnSmith)) which they can share with friends and family on gift-giving occasions (birthdays, Christmas, etc.), featuring a large "donate on behalf of John Smith" button.

			 - Additionally, the user can also set up a recurring monthly / quarterly / yearly donation from his/her own bank account.

			 - All donations are automatically channeled to the beneficiaries as per the user's predefined allocation percentages.

		 - Business case
			 - Revenue
				 - Source of revenue: User defined sliding scale percentage cut of all donations. My Donation Portfolio is included in every user's default portfolio with a 2% allocation. Users can change the allocation or delete it from their portfolio.

				 - Revenue estimation (top down)
					 - ?

				 - Revenue estimation (bottom up)
					 - MDP can get 100,000 users

					 - Average user donates $1,000 per year

					 - Average MDP allocation = 0.5%

					 - Average revenue per user per year = $1,000 * 0.5% = $5.00

					 - Total revenue per year = 100,000 * $5.00 = $500,000.00

			 - Costs
