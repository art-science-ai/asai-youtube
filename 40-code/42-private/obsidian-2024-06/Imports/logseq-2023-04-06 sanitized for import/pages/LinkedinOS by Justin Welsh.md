# My story
- My backstory
	- I was really curious about AI but I didn't know how to use AI to build products for others or a career for myself.
	- GPT-2 launched in 2018, I was blown away by the power of AI and its power to change the world,
	- but I couldn't convince other people to take a chance on me. I started taking some online AI courses and building demo projects I built a succesful career in AI product management, got promoted multiple times and have consistently gotten offers from top companies
- My polarizing opinions
	- You don't need to understand math to build great AI products
	- You don't need to understand code to be a great product manager
