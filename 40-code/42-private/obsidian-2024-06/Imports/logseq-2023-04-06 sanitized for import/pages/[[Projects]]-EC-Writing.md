		 - How to optimize your application?
			 - The goal of the application I think is to prove two claims: (1) that you are sufficiently qualified to succeed in this program (without being over-qualified), and (2) that you are sufficiently motivated to succeed in this program.

			 - How do you prove 1? The simplest way to prove it is you have some college level computer science or programming coursework on a transcript with a good grade. Unfortunately this does not include online certifications and courses (unless they are verified by an accredited university or college).

			 - This is what I did. Luckily I had two computer science and programming courses from Yale (where I did my MBA), and I got good grades in those courses. Moreover, I got on of the professors of those courses to write me a letter of recommendation. If you can do this, you're golden. Nothing more to do.

			 - Of course, what if you don't have this background? Yes, then the best way to do it is to show some proxy for it. First proxy is to demonstrate quantiative skills. Anything with mathematics and data analysis. This can be done in many ways. One way is to submit a good GRE score. But maybe that's too much effort to study for an exam just for this application. Look to college courses with quantitative content. Have you taken calculus, econometrics, data analysis, etc? If you've done well on those courses, that's a good indication that you'll do well at this program.

			 - Other than courses, you can demonstrate quantitative skills through work experience. Have you ever done data analysis at work? Built a model in Excel (or better yet Python)? Don't worry, Excel is good enough. Unfortunately, the work experience method is harder to prove, so you need to do two things. One, you need to write about it in your essay in detail. Do this in a way that demonstrates you know what you're talking about. Second, you should ideally have this corroborated by one of your recommenation writers. Ideally the recommendation writer would be the manager of a project on which you demonstratd those same skills. They should ideally emphasize that you have these skills and abilities.

			 - Another way to prove you're qualified is to take an online computer science course. Try CS50. Incidentally this was one of the courses I took. Get a verified certificate. However, be aware that this will unfortunately carry less weight than a course that is backed up with a college transcript. Therefore, this should be somethign in addition to the other things I've mentioned above.

			 - Next comes the part of proving that you're motivated. This is highly subjective. But in general, you want to describe some personal and professional goals that motivate you, and then you want to make a connection to how this program will help you achieve those goals. Make sure that the goals are not too far fetched. They should be something that's within reach, but just out of reach because you're missing education in computer science and programming. It should have a firm basis in what you've already done with your life. For example, ... think of example. My example is rather boring. I'm already a product manager, but I want to become a better product manager. I'm currently limited by my lack of technical qualifications, because the products I work on are highly technical in nature. Therefore this program will help me meet those goals.

			 - So don't say that your goal is to become an astronaut. Sadly the MCIT will not get you there. Have a realistic goal, tie it to your background, and describe how MCIT will help you achieve that goal.

			 - That's all there is to it. The one caveat I didn't mention is about overqualification. The program website clearly states that if you can waive more than two core courses, you are overqualified for the program. This is basically anyone who took several college courses in the subjects of the core such as data structures and algorithms, discrete math, etc. In such cases, the program is probably not a great fit for you anyway, and you may be better off looking into Penn's CIS masters which is intended for such students. Since there's no online version of Penn's CIS masters, I would look into GATech's OMSCS program in such cases. That's an impeccable program, and I probably would have gone there myself rather than Penn if I had the right qualifications. Remember, Penn's motto is "CS masters for those without CS background".

			 - Also, choose your recommenders wisely. Make sure to brief them about your qualifications and your motivation, and make sure they have the right context of interaction with you to provide supporting evidence for the claims you are making. E.g. if your essay talks about how you are a quant genius, and your recommendations are coming from your English literature professors, this may not be the ideal fit.

		 - So what's the next question to be addressed.

		 - Is this program useful for Product Managers?
			 - Surprisingly my answer to this question is no. Let me explain why. For any area of knowledge, we can arrange it in a stack from a higher level of abstraction, down to a lower level of abstraction.

			 - In computer science, abstraction should be a familiar concept to anybody. My primary contention is that PMs are usually working on products that operate at an extremely high level of abstraction, whereas the curriculum teaches you about things that operate at a much lower level of abstraction. Bridging the gap is often quite hard.

			 - I'll draw an analogy to machine learning. In machine learning, the lowest level of abstraction would be writing algorithms using pure algebraic functions using a library like numpy. A high level of abstraction would be to use a library like fastai or Keras. This is another area that I'm exploring. If your job is to be a PM for a machine learning product, it's not clear that taking an intro to machine learning course (especially the popular bottom-up style courses that Universities teach) would be the best approach to get there. There's always going to be a huge gap in your understanding of how to connect the low level concept to the high level concept. It's very hard to bridge that gap, because you'll have to start at one place and dig very deep. It's easy to get a little bit of a low level understanding and a little bit of a high level understanding, but unless you bridge the gap completely by drilling all the way through, I'm not sure how useful that knowledge is.

			 - Going back to classical CS, MCIT will teach you how transistors work from an ee perspective, how they implement basic logical and arithmetic functions, how to build a CPU, etc. From there it will build up to higher levels of abstraction such as basic programming languages C. Then we learn about data structures and algorithms. That's about as far as we get. Whereas at work, I'm facing decisions such as whether our customers should run their jobs on a single tenant AKS cluster or a shared Ethos (proprietary?) infrastrucutre. There's an entire layer of knowledge that's completely missing here. I need to know how to connect low level concepts to much higher level abstractions of containers, cloud computing, shared infrastructure, etc.

			 - I guess you could argue that there's probably some semester long course that could cover this subject that I'm just missing. Perhaps. Perhaps one day they will offer a course in this area. What's the area?

			 - Let's do a simple high level / low level mapping.
				 - Python web application (Flask API)

				 - Assembly code

				 - Machine language

				 - Logic gates

				 - Transistors

			 - Already in the above chain, you can't connect all the dots. If you can't connect all the dots from the ground up, if there was a big gap, it's not something you can really make use of in your day to day life. It's good for conceptual clarification. Now think about if there are several levels of abstraction above the top most layer of the above chart, and the production systems at your company are working at that level of abstraction. You might as well start at the top directly, there's no way to use this bottom level knowledge, unless there's a connection to the top.

			 - Anyway, this essay needs to be fleshed out in a lot more detail and the examples need to be throught through carefully. I'll put this on hold and come back to it in an editing stage. It's not simply knowledge I have in my head that I'm trying to get out.

		 - What is the time commitment required for this program?
			 - On average the coursework requires 10-12 hours of work per course per week. This includes time spent watching lectures, reading the textbook, working on homework assignments, etc. If you're taking 2 courses per semester your workload will be 20 - 24 hours per week on average.

			 - Part time students are typically enrolled in 1-2 courses per semester and full time students are typically enrolled in 3-4 courses per semester.

			 - Note that the variance will depend on several factors
				 - Intensity of the course: Some courses require a lot more work than others. While the number above is an average, students typically agree that CIT 594 is closer to 4-6 hours / week on average, whereas CIT 593 is closer to 10 - 20 hours / week on average. Not all courses are the same. Note that CIT 593 is unanimously agreed to be the most time intensive course and 594 the least time intensive in the core curriculum.

				 - Your background and aptitude for the subject: While I think that 592 requries an average of 10 - 12 hours / week, this will vary depending on your background and aptitude for discrete math. As someone who was has a strong background in and is very comfortable with logic, mathematical proofs, and basic probability, I was able to get by with 4 - 6 hours / week. Whereas there are several students who discussed on the forums that they needed 10 - 20 hours / week for this course. Some people describe it as the second hardest course after 593.

			 - Based on the variances above, you can figure out how many hours per week you will need to dedicate for coursework. But how many hours you CAN dedicate, depends on your other commitments and obligations in life.
				 - Job responsibilities: If you're juggling this program alongside a full-time job, then it is recommended to do 1-2 courses per semester. Most people do only 1 course, while few do 2 courses. Some jobs are much more demanding than others. I have friends who work in investment banking and management consulting, where they often need to dedicate 60+ hours per week to their jobs. This leaves much less time for coursework compared to other jobs.

				 - Family commitments: Obviously, if you have a family with young children, or if you are responsible for the care of elderly people, etc. you will have much less time to dedicate to your coursework.

				 - Other hobbies and interests: Do you like to go hiking? Play in a band? Etc. Well, consider how those will conflict with your goals.

			 - In general, I think the average person can manage to do 1 course per semester. Yes, that time has to come from somewhere, but it's likely that the average person has 10 - 12 hours / week of time that they can free up if necessary and if they are committed. I would not recommend more than 1 course unless you have exceptions discussed above (e.g. you have familiarity with some of the subjects, you have a very relaxed job, etc.)

		 - Who should apply to this program?
			 - Software is eating the world. In my view, everyone should have a basic understanding of how software works, how it is produced, etc. Of course, maybe this is something you can learn on your own or in some other way without needing a formal education in computer science.

		 - Bootcamp vs. MCIT
			 - This is an interesting topic, because there is a strong overlap in the purpose that is served by a bootcamp vs. MCIT. For a lot of people, they want to get a job as a software developer. You can go the MCIT route or the Bootcamp route. Which one is right for you? There's no right or wrong answer. I strongly considered both options, but decided to do the MCIT. Let's look at the general difference first.

			 - Computer science vs. programming. First we need to understand the distinction between computer science and programming. The former is a theoretical science, while the latter is a practical skill or ability. It's like the difference between physics and electrical engineering. Computer science focuses on theoretical concepts such as algorithms, data structures, etc. Programming is a skill focused on the implementation.

			 - Is computer science necessary for programming? This is obviously not yes or no, but more about HOW MUCH CS is needed for programming? You can do a lot in programming without a CS background. And you can pick up the CS concepts as and when you need them, rather than starting with them.

			 - If your immediate goal is to build a web application that people can use to keep track of their task list. You can get started right away by learning web development framework. Just learn the things you need to know to write the application. But you don't need to understand the underlying theoretical concepts. What's the time complexity of your sorting method for tasks? Don't know. Don't care.

			 - Gaps in both approaches. Both approaches have gaps. There are some things that you will learn ONLY in one approach and not in the other approach. You can complete the MCIT program but still be clueless on how to build an application.

			 - MCIT: The focus of this degree is on computer science rather than programming. Programming is only a secondary focus of the program.
