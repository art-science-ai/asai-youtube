		 - Feedback
			 - Too many pauses
				 - One pause for structure - supply / demand

				 - One pause for listing demand side stages

				 - One pause of listing metrics per stage

			 - Said you would consider actions - but didn't consider actions

			 - Started by saying all three journey stages, the you said engagement only

			 - Priorities - too many!

			 - Debugging - good job! Good list of segments.

			 - Debugging fix - should have mentioned user interviews

			 - Recommendation - too long; don't recap the entire case
