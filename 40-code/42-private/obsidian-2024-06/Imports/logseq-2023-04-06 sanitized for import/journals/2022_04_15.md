			- Hi XX, since we've worked closely together during my time at Adobe, I would really value your feedback for my professional development and growth. I've sent you a request for feedback via Workday. However, this is just between you and me, so if you'd prefer not to use the Workday form, I'm happy to get your feedback via email, Slack, Teams meeting, text message, phone call, or whatever else you are most comfortable with. Thanks in advance for your time! 😊

		- Morning, Lauren! I was just about to reply to your email. Unfortunately I already scheduled another interview and some work meetings today for which I need to prep. Would you mind using the Calendly link I sent in my previous email to find some time for early next week? There are several open slots on Monday! Hope that works.
