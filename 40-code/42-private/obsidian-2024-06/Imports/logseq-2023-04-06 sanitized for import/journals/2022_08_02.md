		 - That's a wrap for the Ads Core ML Signal Loss mitigation summit! We had 15+ presentations across a range of topics under the themes of SL foundations, SL scenario mitigations, ML strategies, and DS perspectives. 

Hopefully this summit helped us all deepen our understanding of SL mitigation and strengthened our xfn collaboration and relationships! Additionally, the recorded video presentations will serve as good future resources for learning about Signal Loss. (I will post an update later this week with links and timestamps to all the presentations and videos).
