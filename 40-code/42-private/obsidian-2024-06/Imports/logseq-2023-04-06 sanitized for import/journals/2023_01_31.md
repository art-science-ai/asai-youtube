- [[Amazon]] Creators meet w [[Ping S]], [[Nathan Soohoo]], [[Darren Scerri]], [[Faizan Bhat]]
	- Recap of vision sprint w Amazon - Faizan
		- Met w Amazon product team on Friday
		- Takeaways in "takeaways from CZ" document - linked in canonical - notes from Jana 27 - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pP9h_YizafdJFNiX7ait2T6IVliWLUm_qlFy7kYCSOs/edit#bookmark=id.zgvltn80w90b
		- CZ = even Faizan didn't know what it meant at first! But it means we want to build a general product for which Amazon is Customer Zero
		- Amazon really cares about control - over which content and creators get boosted - they really care about moderation and brand safety - but they are open to different processes for implementation
		- Also talked about other topics - value economics, importance of incrementality to Amazon, and importance of maximizing creator revenue for Meta
			- Amazon - if creators on our app creating content and driving sales to Amazon, they want to ensure that's incremental revenue, not a sale that would already happen
			- Incrementality = Lift
		- Amazon also cares about diversity in creators and content - but not clear how diversity is prioritized vs performance
	- Ads options workstream
		- Sue: does creative need to be altered before boosting? In terms of link or text
		- Tiffany to pull together workstream
	- JTBD discussion - Faizan
		- I provided clarity on optimized ads delivery vs. optimized creative selection
- Private Delivery review w [[Tal Hayat]]
	- Shadow data - need to build plan
- Mandeepak update a/b test
	- Hi Mandeepak! Yes, that's a great idea — I was planning to set up weekly meetings for both the workstreams I'm driving (Ranking and A/B testing). Let me kick off the A/B test series this week.
	- Status of this workstream is tracked here [1], but we are still blocked on the MDE understanding. German has assigned the STO for A/B testing as Dmitrii Ivanovskii, and Ugene Liu (Commerce DS manager) as interim STO while Dmitrii is on PTO. Ugene + Chuan are still aligning on the methodology for MDE estimation.

		- Showed vulnerability about my goals and issues with culture at Meta
	- Faizan's philosophy around XFN
		- Worked on lot of XFN projects - early on become about who is doing what vs. problem scoping and definiiton
		- Faizan intentionally tried to create a culture around problem scoping and definition rather than silo-ing into
	- Three step approach and canonical milestones

		- M2: Developing Meta PoV; workshop with Amazon
		- M3: Breaking down into components - organic, ads, etc.

				- Campaigns segmented by categories - home, toys, creator - fashion, creator - home, etc.
				- Cost capped bidding
				- Link click optimization
				- Ad set level
					- Custom audiences segmented by Amazon's internal knowledge of user propensity to convert
					- Amazon expresses value to us through these segments - they assign higher budgets to high pri audiences - bid multipliers
			- Semi automated
				- Mix of API + UI (Ads manager)
			- Experimentation accounts - all manual
		- Bulk of spend from fully automated accounts
	- Creator program
		- Using dynamic ads with carousel
		- Might move to BCA - branded content ads
	- Prospecting vs re-engagement
		- They are focused on re-engagement - especially in countries where they have a lot of 1PD

- Core ML PM Weekly w [[Sagar Pilania]], [[Arun Rao]]
	-
- Amazon Buy with Prime meet w [[Sagar Pilania]], [[Nathan Soohoo]], [[Yucheng]]
	- What are we optimizing for here? What are Amazon's goals?
	- Does Amazon's data benefit it's competitors?
		- Sagar says some conversion signals (like click level) benefit Amazon a lot more than it benefits others
	- What to ask Amazon for
		- Start w CAPI / Pixel
		- Back-off to click level conversion signal (later view level) i.e. attributed data
	- Amazon signal sharing philosophy
		- Amazon understands the value of sharing conversion signal, but refuses to share due to privacy and competition risks.
		- For Creator Ads, they may be willing to make an exception to meet the goal of maximizing creator revenue to attract more creators.
		- For Buy With Prime, there is no such special incentive for Amazon, so they will likely fallback to their default approach of not sharing conversion signal.
- Amazon BWP meeting w [[Samantha Maciel]], [[Sagar Pilania]]
	- About BWP - UX
		- User sees Amazon Prime ad on FB / IG
		- User will see PDP - product discovery page - custom URL - this is a third party surface
		- Click BWP asks you to connect Amazon account
		- Complete checkout within IG app
	- Two types of BWP ads
		- Ads from Amazon
		- Ads from DTC advertisers using BWP
	- BWP conversion signal - 3PD vs 1PD
		- 1PD requires more PXFN approval and longer timeline
		- For now, we start w 3PD flow
	- MVP
		- Need to design experience for both flows - D2C and 1P
		- Mapped out shopper experience - need corresponding advertiser side experience
- 1-1 [[Marvin Kim]]
	- Agenda
		- Career advice / growth
	- UGC learnings
		- Started w .25% adscore goal from UGC then had a long term goal of 2-3%
		- After poking around, concluded that the long term numbers were way off
		- Debated whether they should get an accurate number or not w DS
	- Private Delivery
		- Why is PC investing in this if delivery is not funded? Won't it be regrettable work if delivery doesn't get funded?
	- Marvin working on SoT
		- Platform side
			- looks pretty scary right now
			- Sharing w Fred this week - want to publish ASAP
		- Regulation
			- step 1 - identifying threats - issues still unclear
			- ETA next week or two - step 1
		- Ali owns this initiative
	- Next meeting - discuss goals and career growth - ask for feedback
- [[Therapy]] w [[Tucker Peck]]
	- Agenda
		- Did dry January!
		- Meditation update
			- Break down see / hear / feel?
		- Hobbies - not much progress
	- Vulnerability with parents
		- Parents are there for me in a pragmatic way - but not in an emotional or caring way
		- Also they don't treat me respectfully as a fellow adult
		- It's very hard for most parents to accept their kids as adults. But in this case - do they even have emotional intimacy with other people in their lives?
		- There needs to be a relationship conversation
		- It makes me really sad to think that we may not fix this in our lifetimes
		- It's really important to me to make this better
		- Need to help them understand how important this is to me
		- It's sadness, but it's also sweet
	- I felt really sad and started crying
		- Tucker asks: what do I need to assuage this? Love and affection from my parents and accepting who I am
		- I need to know that I did my best
	- Action: have a conversation with my parents telling them that it's really important to me that we have a better relationship

- Saurabh / Brian thread
	- Hi Brian! Saurabh (Meta Checkout) is looking to connect with a POC from the Ads Surface team (i.e. FB / IG clients) who can help understand how Ad context is handled by client teams. More context in the below doc. Do you have any idea who we can reach out to for this request?
	  
	  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WoExnUkE8hE5rYSOJCD3rbVSotJvjGzDoxqiPWx8PKI/edit #shareadoc
- Ben comment
	- Yeah, the linked marsci study was interesting and concluded that
	  
	  > Conversion optimization drives 0.5-3x more conversions for the optimized event, as well as significant incremental conversions throughout the funnel. ROAS increases by 0.5x to 1.5 x for certain e-commerce clients who shared conversion values with us.
	  
	  My concerns: it's from 2017 and is based on studies done on small businesses whereas I'm working on a business case for Amazon to share conversion signal with Meta!
