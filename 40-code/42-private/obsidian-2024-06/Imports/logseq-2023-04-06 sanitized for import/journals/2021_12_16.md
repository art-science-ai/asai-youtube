- One medical call w [[Alka]] for [[Lower back pain due to L5 S1 protrusion]]
	 - If bulge goes out it's called a bulge, if it goes in, it's called hernia

	 - My disk isn't as bad as bulging, but it's just misplaced slightly - pushing against muscles causing pain

	 - Not a very abnormal report; enough to explain plain, but not enough to worry

	 - No injury, no neurological issues

	 - I could have had this protrusion for years - this MRI doesn't
