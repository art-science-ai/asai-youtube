- DONE LASA issues
	 - We are working on two solutions for LASA's SQL orchestration issues - a long term solution and an interim solution:

	 - Long term solution
		 - PLAT-71844: Query Orchestration for SQL Interactive.

		 - This will expose ETL APIs (and ultimately UI) for customers to run chained and triggered SQL queries.

		 - Estimated timeline: 2021-Q4

	 - Interim solution
		 - PLAT-85612: Migrate LASA's custom Python Orchestration scripts to AEP Anonymous Block API.

		 - In the interim, we propose to migrate your orchestration scripts to AEP anonymous blocks in order to avoid breaking connection between Python scripts and AEP Query Service.

		 - Estimated timeline: 2021-Q2.

	 - Other suggestions
		 - QS team has noticed issues with python script and requested to refresh qs connection before any ctas statement execution.

- COGS meeting with [[Hazem Zmeili]], [[Andrew Chen]]
	 - DONE Define metrics to be emitted to observability (include dimenstions - IMS org, Batch vs Interactive, Service token, Sandbox ID, etc.)

	 - Next step after defining the meters is to audit the meters

	 - Cost computation will be done with the help of operational intelligence team.
