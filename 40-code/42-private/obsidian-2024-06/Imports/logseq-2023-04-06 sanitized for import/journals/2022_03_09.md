	 - Yes Nikhil, so there is this eVar - adb.event.context.dv.promo_experiment_cohorts ( v204 ) in which we log a key - **CoD_Device_Eligibility** where we mention the CoD Device type.

	 - The value of which is CoD_NotEligible ( for a device that is neither W1 nor W2 ), W1CoD_Eligible ( for a W1 device ) and W2CoD_Eligible ( for a W2 device ).
