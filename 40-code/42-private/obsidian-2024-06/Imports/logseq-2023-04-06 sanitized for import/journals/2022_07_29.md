	 - About Santanu org
		 - Sri - ML features team

		 - Wenlin - ML modeling team, efficiency, etc.

	 - OBA mitigation
		 - AEMv2 makes model iteration possible; offline eval makes it possible to iterate on the model; before then we used the same model for opt-in+opt-out

		 - Now they finally have a v1 model and it is leading to improvement

		 - Challenge: we will get pressure from leadership to improve it more and scale to more models beyond 1dct; how to coordinate xfn to scale to other models - to 1dCT

	 - DONE She wants to know: who is the PM for ATT

	 - Signal gain and MPC-ML
		 - MPC-ML is a sub-part of signal gain; Pretty high confidence that Advertisers will be ready to jump on to this; those advertisers already using PC Lift

	 - MPC-ML vs MPC-PCO
		 - PCO is a term that is understandable by advertisers

		 - MPC-ML can also be applied to other models other than CO models (i.e. 1dct model) - e.g. long attribution / view-through optimization

- 1-1 w [[Matthew Feucht]]
	 - About Mattthew
		 - PC platform team; building products for both Ads measurement and ads delivery based on private computation

		 - Working on Ads measurement for the past year, but now shifting focus to delivery

	 - Ads stack
		 - Ads ranking
			 - Process of making a prediction of cvr

			 - No real-time model, but it's a weekly refreshed model

			 - MPC-ML tackles ranking 

		 - Calibration
			 - Calibration moves us from weekly refreshed model to near real-time model; there's lot of variation due to not refreshing the model

		 - QRT (internal A/B testing)
			 - We want acurate estimate of real conversions, this needs MPC to account for opt-out OBA/ATT users

	 - MPC / PC use cases for delivery
		 - MPC-ML covers ranking

		 - PC for Delivery Health - covers calibration and QRT - also helps pacing and bidding

	 - Org structure
		 - First time MPC-ML team is getting PM support - big step for them

		 - PXFN - I should be on the drivers seat of pxfn review - take it through AAL unit rather than PC unit?

	 - PXFN process
		 - Talk to Privacy Program Manager (PPM) first

		 - Approver will be the PPM and the lawyer for that unit

	 - APT review - central privacy review
		 - This happens in parallel with or after pxfn

	 - DONE Start PXFN doc and chat thread #[[[[Projects]]-MPC]]

	 - Get market segmentation - past and present

		 - PXFN needs endorsement from central privacy team

	 - DONE Set up weekly 1-1

	 - DONE Create chat group for pxfn / lama mpc-ml #[[[[Projects]]-MPC]]
