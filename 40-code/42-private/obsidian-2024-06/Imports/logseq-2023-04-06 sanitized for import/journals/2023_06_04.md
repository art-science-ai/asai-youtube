- Planning Dad birthday
  collapsed:: true
	- Hi, hope you're doing well!
	  
	  For my dad's 60th birthday celebration on June 8th evening, we would like to have a few close friends and family speak a few words about him. 
	  
	  As one of his closest friends, it would be great if you could also participate! There will be only 4-5 speakers and each person will speak for just 1-2 minutes. Can you please confirm if you're okay with this?

	- One more thing (this part is a SURPRISE): Since my mom and dad are both turning 60 this year, we want this event to celebrate both of them.
