- [[Mindbloom - Ketamine]] integration call 3 w [[Estephenia Solis]]
	 - My questions
		 - How to bring transformations to life?

		 - How to bridge dream world with waking world?

	 - Waking world is based on the default mode network; dream world is different

	 - Think of it as left-brain vs. right-brain; the trips are activating my right-brain thinking; creative, free-thinking

	 - DONE Creative writing practice based on dreams and trips - add it to my schedule

	 - Trip during camping experience 
		 - Started with my friends blessing me on my journey

		 - Questions to ask
			 - What happens to the character?

			 - What's in the water when I go underwater? Maybe I have gills?

		 - Lucid dreaming / astral projections - this is my dream body

	 - Start by doing the creative writing immediately after the journey; then continue later

	 - My work-self is quite disconnected from my creative side of me

	 - DONE Have micro-moments of mindfulness and creativity during the day - just write down thoughts - deep breathing, etc.

	 - Make creative / messy thinking my default mode when I'm bored; "what if" journaling.

- [[micro-journal]]
	 - This should be my new default practice. The micro-journal. Whenever I have a couple of mins to spare. Instead of mindlessly scrolling online, like scrolling is the new smoking, journal.

	 - Not just any journal though! Try to make it creative!

	 - What if... I could live underwater. I'm swimming with the fish underwater. Everything is blue. It's actually a very dark deep blue. Unlike the shallow light blue that we see on the surface of oceans, rivers, and lakes. Inside the ocean is a deep blue. It's a happy place inside, where I'm swimming with the fish. What kind of fish are there? There are little fish and big fish, of all colors. They're dancing around in circles around me. It's like that disney movie - what's it called? Finding Nemo! How did I even get into this underwater world? I was just transported there.
