		 - Summary
			 - Gopal was born to a traditional Indian family with a mix of Hindu and royal heritage. However, instead of a river goddess, Gopal's mother could be a highly educated and spiritual woman who instilled in him a strong moral compass and respect for tradition. Perhaps Gopal's father was a successful businessman and they lived in a wealthy household.

			 - In his childhood, Gopal could have been exposed to a mix of traditional and modern education, including classical Indian music and dance, as well as technology and science.

		 - Once upon a time, there lived an ascetic named Valmiki who was curious about finding a truly virtuous man. He went to the sage Narada and asked him if there was such a man in the world who was both mighty and knowledgeable, always spoke the truth, and was benevolent to all creatures. Narada, who was familiar with all the three worlds, was delighted to hear Valmiki's question and thought for a moment before answering.

		 - He then spoke of a man named Rama who was born in the House of Ikvaku and was known to all men. Rama was self-controlled, mighty, and wise, and was also eloquent and marked with all auspicious signs. He had a broad chest and mighty arms, and his proportions were perfect. He was also valorous and had a dark complexion. Narada concluded by saying that Rama possessed all the qualities that Valmiki was searching for in a virtuous man.

		 - And so, Valmiki learned of Rama and was filled with awe at his noble character and virtuous qualities. And that, dear listeners, is the story of how Valmiki learned about the virtuous man he was searching for.
