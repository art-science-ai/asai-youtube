- Update to [[Rohit Iyer]]
	 - Hi Rohit — Here's an update on my follow-ups:

1/ I set up the infra meeting. You, me, and Hang are available but David's calendar is blocked. LMK if David is required and I can reschedule.

2/ I set up a recurring 1-1 for us on Mondays. We can reduce frequency or even cancel after some time.

3/ Added you to two recurring project meetings (maybe you can attend the first one or two weeks just to get an idea and then decide if you want to stop attending)

3a/ "Signal Growth Ranking | 1PD HVR Track | Working Group Sync" on Mondays. This is the Core ML team meeting

3b/ "1PD Ads Integration Weekly Review" on Wednesdays. This is the large XFN meeting with Signals, Infra, and all partner teams

4/ Sharing the canonical docs for Core ML team [3a] and for larger XFN + X-org team [3b]
