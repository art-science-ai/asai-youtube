	- DONE Ask for AI startups info
		- I'm looking to better understand the current state of AI startups
		- Specifically, I'm looking for
			- 1/ What are the major investment areas and their sizes
			- 2/ What are the top 5-10 startups in each area
- MFT workshop for [[John Gore]]
- Call w [[Avinash Mandava]]
	- General thoughts
		- 1 transformer model takes input and generates output
		- Trend towards decomposing prompts into chain of thought
		- Some startups trying to deal with enterprise data - Adept AI
	- Prompt decomposition / chain of thought is a big deal right now
	- Reaction to startup
		- Sounds good, but why will we win in this space? Other companies have larger install base and better feedback loop for RLHF
		- Incumbents = Open AI, Microsoft, Google Assistant, Alexa
		- Bear case
			- Incumbents respond quickly
			- Hard to get traction from customers outside big companies - would people pay for this? no
			- B2C - can only be acquired by big tech due to no revenue
			- B2B - can actually generate revenue streams
			- Outcome - fast acquisition - terms are only favorable if we don't raise a lot of money - best case $100M
		- Bull case
			- Incumbents don't respond soon enough
			- Maybe too small to capture attention of incumbent
	- Threats
		- Competition from incumbents
		- Competition from copycats
	- B2C
		- B2C will cost money - do cost analysis of how much API call will cost
		- Incumbents have lot more market power and money
	- B2B
		- Companies reluctant to give up data
	- Platform play - alternate idea
		- Can we be value add on top of other models obfuscating complexity of language models? For developers to build experiences on top of my platform
		- Obfuscate the different models coming out - build on top of our platform, and we will enable your customers to get a good experience
		- This way companies pay for API usage
		- If more model providers come out beyond OpenAI - my customers have a simpler UI than dealing with all the model providers
		- Value we offer: Data integration - connecting your back-end database with what your customers want - we'll make that easy
		- We get more power over our suppliers - won't be beholden to model supplier
		- All companies want to build their own chatbots - that's the problem I'm trying to solve
	- Investor relations
		- Investors are not leaders - tell them to fuck off; we are offering value; you can buy into it
	- Business road test
		- Talk to 10-20 companies varied sample
		- Validate what type of companies have interest - size of company, industry, etc.
		- Then talk to 10-20 more companies in that filter
		- Rinse and repeat
		- Co-design with 5 companies as design partners - prototypes - etc.
		- Prioritize engagement, not money
		- Then build sales motion that's low touch - build product led growth
		- Need 500k ACV to get enterprise sales staff
	- Company that's already doing this - Avinash will find - high quality customer service chatbots
	- Next steps
		- Develop hypotheses to test
			- AI will become a platform
			- Text is the universal interface - Whatsapp can become like Wechat
		- DONE Other people to talk to
			- Hossam
			- Neil
		- DONE Books
			- Business Road Test
			- Steve Blank
