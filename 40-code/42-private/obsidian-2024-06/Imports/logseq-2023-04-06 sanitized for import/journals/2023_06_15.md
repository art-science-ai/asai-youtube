		- Hi @Kassy Coan, @Nathan Schloss — I met with @Apurva Pathak and @Shuai Liu today to review the ABD mitigations w.r.t. Ranking Signal and we determined:
		  
		  1) No-bounce and dwell time: Mitigation #3 mitigates 87% of loss (updated in the doc)
		  
		  2) Autofill: We need someone from the Autofill team to review the mitigations and/or propose new mitigations. The recommended POCs are Khai Ly (Eng) and Jorge Gabuardi (PM)
