	- I gave a talk titled "Intro to Signal Loss and Signal Growth" to a few teams outside Ads that I collaborate with (e.g. Meta FinTech and Commerce teams), and it was very well received by those teams. I was wondering if there might be an opportunity for me to present this at our Monetization AI PM offsite?
