- [[Waymo]] on-site interviews for Trucking Role
	 - References
		 - [[PM Interview Cheat Sheet]]

		 - [[Behavioral Interview stories]]

		 - Metrics
			 - Disengagements per 1000 miles (currently 0.03)

			 - Collisions (in simulation)

			 - Expert driver vs prediction

		 - Questions for interviewer
			 - What do you work on?

			 - What areas would we collaborate on in this role?

			 - Rule based vs ML for planning?

	 - Jul 12, 2021 10:45am-11:30am PDT Interviewers: [[Michael Wattendorf]]
		 - Intro
			 - Waymo 3+ yrs

			 - First joined "onboard" team; code that controls the driver

			 - Then shifted to "offboard" team - simulation ande valuation; provide engineers with tools to evaluate the impact of changes to technology

		 - Case 1
			 - Challenge
				 - Disengage - switch from autonomous to manual mode

				 - Types of disengagements indiciate priority

				 - Collision after disengage (predicted in simulation)

				 - Scariest: other vehicles cutting into us; we need to hit the brakes

			 - Key metrics
				 - Disengagements per M miles
					 - Disengagements with collision

				 - Number of collisions per M miles

			 - How to approach?
				 - Break down prediction vs planning

				 - Run 

			 - How to know when done?
				 - Metrics

			 - Challenge
				 - 2 modes of simulation - 

				 - 1 - follow the exact track (just for prediction); locked to ego-vehicle position

				 - 2 - pose-divergent simulation;

			 - Divergent simulation  
				 - Break-down prediction accuracy vs. planning accuracy

		 - Questions end
			 - Michael - simulation team PM overall Waymo level; not just trucking

			 - Provide the right eval tooling for developers; owns the suite of producgts for eval

			 - Trucking simulation - we have diff. needs than onboard; driving on freeways; bigger vehicles; how to meet those requirements?

			 - Liason between eval

		 - Types of evaluation
			 - Release level evaluation - Package main software and run a ton of miles and make sure no collisions; expensive one off simulation

			 - Diff based evaluation - I just give a code change to Michael; base vs. test how much did metrics change

	 - Date/Time: Jul 12, 2021 1:15pm-2:00pm PDT Interviewers: [[Andrew Stein]]
		 - Intro
			 - 2 yrs ago; joined from Anki

			 - Perception side of Trucking team

		 - Case 
			 - Goal
				 - Driving in the middle of nowhere; something gone wrong with Truck; sensing / driving OK; need to pull over on the freeway; how to find pull-over

			 - High level approach

			 - Rule based approach
				 - Right lane

				 - Tailgate

				 - Shoulder exists

		 - End discussions
			 - Andrew works on perception level simulation for rare events

			 - Org structure for Trucking
				 - Perception team

				 - Behavior team - prediction and planning

			 - Dotted line reporting to both trucking org and to Waymo One org

	 - Date/Time: Jul 12, 2021 2:00pm-2:45pm PDT Interviewers: [[Brad Neuman]]
		 - Intro
			 - Brad - behavior; andrew on perception; they work closely together

			 - 2 yrs in; still a new product; like a scrappy team within Waymo

			 - Interview goal - figure out how I work with eng; fit for different roles; hypotheticals

		 - Behavioral - data prep story
			 - Arch disagreements

			 - Butting heads w/ engineers

		 - Case
			 - Challenge
				 - emergency truck runaway ramps - if truck loses braking ability, then it runs into the uphill ramp

				 - Correlated fault - cuts through redundancy

			 - Input
				 - Signal that says we have failure

		 - End questions
			 - Motion planning team lead

			 - Same technical infrastructure as core team; focus on aspects unique to trucking

			 - Roles
				 - Focused on evaluation - coming up with metrics for simulation

				 - Planner team - diving deep into requirements for planner

			 - PM culture
				 - 

	 - Date/Time: Jul 12, 2021 3:00pm-3:45pm PDT Interviewers: [[Frances Guo]]
		 - Intro
			 - Waymo 1 yr; motion control eng team; downstream from Waymo

			 - Q: PM Org structure

		 - Case 1
			 - Problem
				 - Construction zones on freeways

		 - Case 2
			 - Problem
				 - Self driving is widely adoped; over 50% self driving vehicles

			 - Users
				 - Drivers / passsengers
					 - Commuters

					 - Road-trippers

				 - Insurers

				 - Goods transportaion

				 - Auto manufacturers 

			 - Use cases
				 - Commuting

				 - Road-trip

			 - User needs
				 - Be productive

				 - Relax

				 - Social

				 - Mobile home

			 - Product ideas
				 - Waymo One

		 - Case 3 - behavioral; why Waymo

		 - End questions
			 - PM org
				 - 6 PMs; Shai manages Frances and one other PM

				 - Shai - perception, operations

			 - Role
				 - Lot of eval component

- [[Therapy]] with [[Tucker Peck]]
	 - My issues with meditation
		 - I'm reifying things - like failure sensation

		 - Making some progress in the background - like I'm able to better describe sensations

	 - Did a hear-in hear-out meditation

	 - Phrase: growth mindset; notice the small wins

	 - HW
		 - Continue with body scan meditation practice; if thoughts are intense, do hear-in meditation;

		 - When OCPD thoughts coming in, try to do a mini-meditation practice

	 - Discussing indecisiveness and lack of commitment to work; where does it come from?

	 - Theory: I'm lacking the capabilities in terms of discipline, will-power, etc. But why can't that change?

	 - Theory: Parents sheltered me a lot, and I didn't develop ambition as a result.

	 - Theory: I did what my parents wanted me to do - bourgeois life - and now I've stopped.

	 - Theory: I'm trapped by golden handcuffs; trapped by the comforts of my life.

	 - I've compromised on my career and goals

	 - My lack of commitment for business ideas is similar to my lack of commitment for PhD research ideas

	 - I do have ambition - I'm just not executing on them; make a commitment to spend time on developing business ideas
