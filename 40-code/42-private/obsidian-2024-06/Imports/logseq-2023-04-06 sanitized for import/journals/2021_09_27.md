		 - Keep doing it

	 - Frustrated part of me
		 - At the same time feels like age 40 and 3; sometimes it should be treated as an adult

		 - Like a father figure; need to control and a frustration and inabilty to do that

		 - Relate to the child-like nature, rather than the adult nature

		 - Ignore the part that's like the adult 

		 - Give it love, comfort, affection; 

	 - Concrete steps
		 - Step 1: Notice that it's the anxiety voice

		 - Step 2: Ignore the content, relate to the emotional need; 

		 - Step 3: find the loving part of the self, by step-wise de-identifying from whatever I'm feeling 

		 - Step 4: provide the love and affection
