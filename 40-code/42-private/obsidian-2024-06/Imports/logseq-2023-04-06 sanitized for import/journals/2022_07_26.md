		 - Joined S&P - statistics and privacy - 2.5 years ago - research team that also builds incubation products

		 - Original focus was not MPC - started with TEE - trusted execution environment - but got feedback that TEE was not mature enough, but maybe later this year

		 - Prior to Meta - Amazon seller fraud team - using ML to identify fake reviews etc; worked on building those models - started w customer review based model - moved to much larger model based on seller relationship graph

		 - Prior to Amazon - statistitian at Google - for brand advertisers ads effectiveness

	 - MPC-ML
		 - Advertisers are not sharing conversion signals with us - add to cart, etc. - because of privacy concerns

	 - [[[[Projects]]-MPC]]
		 - Clarify the questions to be asked

		 - Legal questions to answer?
			 - Can we do stuff in MPC that we couldn't do before? For ATT and for OBA?

			 - Specifically, can we do ATT de-ID in MPC? Can we do XYZ for delivery?

			 - Can we get around OBA?

		 - Marvin thinks the answers will be no

		 - Example scenarios
			 - Amazon - does not share conversion data

			 - Walmart - does share conversion data

			 - Worst case scenario
				 - I can at least convince Amazon to become like Walmart

			 - Best case scenario
				 - I can also improve optimization for Walmart

		 - People
			 - Two pxfn groups - one for OBA

			 - One for EPD - EU Privacy Directive - strictest

- MPC-ML use cases
	 - MPC-based Private Conversion Optimization (MPC PCO) has two use cases: signal loss and signal gain. (See this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKRDJFdZxtY77Aety5fzPBUO4bqE162R4v1pnDvCpzA/edit#bookmark=id.jon5evinly43)

	 - Signal Loss: this use case requires validation from pxfn. Main question: can we use MPC PCO for ATT / OBA scenarios?

	 - Signal Gain: this use case requires validation from customers. Main question: will MPC PCO motivate privacy concerned advertisers to share conversion data?
