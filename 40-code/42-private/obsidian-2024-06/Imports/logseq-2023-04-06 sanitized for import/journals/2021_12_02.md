		 - Context
			 - In the existing viewer for Liquid Mode, users can click on actions such as Comment / Fill & Sign / Edit / etc. but we have no way to track these user journeys in Adobe Analytics. We can track events such as "Comment:Mode:Enter Comment"; however, there is no way to know whether such events were triggered from Liquid Mode or from Classic View. This makes it impossible to answers questions such as "how many users went into commenting mode from Liquid Mode?" (see full list of such questions below).

			 - With the introduction of the Modern viewer for Liquid Mode, there are even more click-through-actions that we would  like to track in Adobe Analytics. Therefore, we would like to implement the Analytics requirements listed in this page for both the existing viewer as well as the modern viewer for Liquid Mode.

		 - Business questions to be answered
			 - How many users clicked on Comment / Draw / Text / Sign in the context menu in Liquid Mode?

			 - How many users clicked on Highlight, underline / strikethrough / read aloud / comment in the context menu for selected text in Liquid Mode?

			 - How many users clicked on Highlight / Draw / Text / Sign / More tools on the bottom toolbar in Liquid Mode?

			 - How many users clicked on Edit / Export / Combine / Compress / etc. in the More Tools section in Liquid Mode?

		 - Events to be implemented
			 - Events for each click on the bottom toolbar: Highlight / Draw / Text / Sign / More tools

			 - Events for each click in the context menu:  Comment / Draw / Text / Sign

			 - Events for each click in the context menu for selected text: Highlight, underline / strikethrough / read aloud / comment

			 - Events for each click in the More Tools section: Edit / Export / Combine / Compress / etc.

		 - Context variables to be implemented
			 - evar to track whether user is in Liquid Mode or Classic View (this evar can be used in conjunction with above events to track whether actions such as commenting were performed from Liquid Mode vs. Classic View)
