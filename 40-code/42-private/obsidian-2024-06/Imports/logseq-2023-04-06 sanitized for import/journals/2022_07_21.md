- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Zhonghua Qu]]
	 - DONE Redmond MOdera article send

	 - About Zhonghua
		 - Joined Meta in 2015 - working on ads the whole time - started w dynamic creative optimization (for optimizing creative ads) - then moved on to modeling - then calibration (prediction robustness) - from 2021 started w PPML project

		 - Currently TL for PPML - AAL

	 - OBA / AAL
		 - Current model for OBA is trained on opt-in data
			 - Normalization for using unlabled - for transfer learning

		 - Improvement this year
			 - More transfer learning techniques for training

			 - Start w AAL for OBA opt-out and double opt-out - plan to revise these models

			 - Then go through mastercook and pick the best candidate

	 - OBA not doing well right now
		 - One of the models doing badly right now

		 - Lot of models for OBA within 1DCT - different stages
			 - Finder

			 - Indexer

			 - Unifier

		 - Ad finder - most important model - not doing very well right now based on A&A offline evaluation

	 - Mitigation plan for SEV
		 - Today - discuss mitigation model - then do quick online test

		 - DONE Ask to be looped into the discussion

		 - Close the revenue gap with an emergency model now and then in Oct.

		 - PM support may be needed for coordination w - QRT 
			 - Lixing

			 - Jamie Wang

			 - Xiao Wen

	 - Other issues
		 - We're focusing on ad finder now, but what about other models? are they also suffering? May want to investigate.

- MPC opportunity sizing meeting w [[Santanu Kolay]], [[Sha Meng]], [[Sonam Saxena]], etc. on [[[[Projects]]-MPC]]
	 - I'm very lost on this meeting, lol!

	 - Side convo w Sonam - Relationship between MPC-ML

- [[[[Projects]]-MPC]] meet w [[Andy Forquer]], [[Sonam Saxena]]
	 - Agenda 
		 - Background and context of market sizing study - when? / why? / etc.

		 - Potential market 25B - how?

	 - Context from Andy
		 - Open questions around market adoption / market size for PETs

		 - Only got about 100 survey respondents in the study - surveyed account teams in FB rather than customer directly

		 - Tied the survey together with spend data

	 - How did we get 25B size?
		 - Total revenue for vertical - look at how much on average they spend if they use bottom of funnel, and extrapolate that to customers 

	 - Problem!
		 - Main concern for most concerns is around competitor privacy rather than user privacy

		 - Our solution is only addressing user privacy?

- OBA model investigation w [[Zhonghua Qu]], [[Wei Wu]], [[Jen Solyanik]]

- [[Reforge - Product Strategy]]

- 1-1 [[Sonam Saxena]]
	 - Sonam wants to use and industry lens for segmentaiton
		 - Customer privacy means something very different for ecom vs. healthcare

	 - DONE Ask Andy for contacts for account management teams

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Saied Tahaghoghi]]
	 - About Saied
		 - Worked MSFT for 13 yrs; wife is doctor; working remotely since 2013

		 - Worked on Bing multimedia - offline measurement platform

		 - Joined Meta in 2020-2021 - been working on SL ever since

		 - Two tracks: readiness (for new scenarios) and win-back (for ATT / OBA / etc.); 

		 - Saied owns ads score overall

	 - Strategy project - [[[[Projects]]-MPC]]
		 - Look into CAPI - could be related

	 - OBA mitigation
		 - Blunt hammer approach: most safe approach; just remove all past data for opt-out users; this is the nuclear option

		 - Tactful hammer approach: intermediate approach
