	 - Split personality between manager persona and employee persona; I identify mostly with the manager persona

	 - I need to start identifying with the employee notes; start having more compassion for this persona; how do we find common ground and common interests?

	 - What's the reason for the employee side is rebelling? Tired of doing things in which it has no interest. Too shackled.

	 - This manager - employee relationship is like the parent - child relationship. Could the breakdown be indicative of a breakdown in my parent child relation in my childhood?

	 - Where is the passion in what I'm doing? Maybe that's why the employee is rebelling. I haven't found my calling yet. Goals can unify the self. Is that what I need?
