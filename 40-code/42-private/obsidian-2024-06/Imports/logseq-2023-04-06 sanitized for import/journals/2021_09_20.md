- [[Therapy]] w [[Jurgen Braungardt]]
	 - Reflecting on progress I've made - 
		 - I'm able to distance myself from thoughts and anxiety and depression

		 - Progress is due to therapy, my own curiosity, and Rukma's help

	 - Missing piece - is the understanding of the causal story from my parents
		 - Decoding this is helpful, and will help me gain insight

		 - What was missing in my childhood that leads me to think that I'm a failure or inadequate?

		 - Father is pretty controlling - tells me what to do and looks through me

		 - Maybe I don't have enough differentiation from my father?

		 - Predominant emotion is irritability and anger

		 - Could be an expression of patriarchal desires

	 - Incident - I kept beating myself up last weekend about failing to make chicken properly
		 - Maybe this explains some of my mom's behavior? Why she's always defensive towards the world.

		 - I have internalized the victimhood. I probably didn't fully live up to my father's expectations as a child, and now I suffer those failures internally.

		 - Didn't have a major incident / encounter with my father, but just day to day small things
