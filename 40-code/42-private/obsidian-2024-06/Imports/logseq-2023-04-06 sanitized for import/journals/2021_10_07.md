- 1-1 w [[Tianyuan Cai]]
	 - Agenda
		 - I need to deprioritize this project

		 - Can you take the lead on this going forward and I can advise you?

	 - 

- [[[[Projects]]-LM User Interviews]] internal [[Adobe]] w [[Kevin Gibbs]]
	 - PDF creation example
		 - Contracts or invoices

		 - Invoices for side business

	 - Invoice creation workflow - side photography business
		 - Info from clients; how many photos they're looking for, etc.

		 - Excel spreadsheet template; 

		 - Convert to PDF

	 - Distribution
		 - Email attachment

	 - ACTION
		 - Just to know what to expect

		 - PDF makes it more preofessional 

		 - Next action - verbal agreement

	 - Why PDF
		 - PDF gives a professional look (rather than Excel spreadsheet)

		 - Locked document

		 - Alternative - quickbooks, or invoicing software

	 - How clients interact with them
		 - Desktop / mobile

		 - Mobile vs. desktop - PDF associated very much with Desktop

		 - Frustrating to 

	 - Problems
		 - Generating a PDF was frustrating - because of print to PDF; now there's tighter integration with Office 365

	 - Viewing on mobile
		 - Don't really view PDF on phone

		 - Sometimes view on Mobile - pinch and zoom is the main pain point

		 - Edit on PDF devices

	 - Other feedback - Edit
		 - Edit mode on desktop is complicated; want more MS Word functionality in PDFs

		 - E.g. trying to edit promotional material... spacing of sentences; then abandoned the project
