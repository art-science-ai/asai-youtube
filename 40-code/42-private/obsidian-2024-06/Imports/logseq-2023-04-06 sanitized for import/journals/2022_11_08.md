	 - Tix booking
		 - I'm supposed to be booking tickets for the Peru trip, but feeling a lot of resistance to doing that. Resistance is coming from feelings of guilt / disappointment at having put it off so long. Also a feeling of overwhelm and failure that I haven't been doing it. I notice there's nothing else preventing me from doing this.

		 - What's my current MO? I look at a list of tasks and then pick one or two to do, but sometimes I'm just stuck in a state of paralysis

		 - Should I just bite the bullet and do the CUS task? Yes, it will make me feel bad for putting it off, but my as well do it rather than not, right?
