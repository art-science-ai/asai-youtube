- Signal Growth ABTest Measurement Vision (In-Review) w [[BG Goyal]], [[Sonam Saxena]]
	- BG and Sonam say that they can help us with QRT Detectability and MDE
	- Sonam Q:
		- Excited to hear about the vision and progress you're making
		- Do you have any process in place where your team provides consultation on A/B testing? One project I'm working on is 1PD from Meta Pay and Meta Checkout,
	- DONE Set up time w Sonam + BG on MDE understanding #[[[[Projects]]-1PD]]
- Chat w [[Damien Lefortier]]
	- 1PD goals
		- Understand key 1PD adoption drivers & barriers by advertiser segment/vertical: What are the functionality and performance gaps that exist with specific 3PD solutions that we need to fill in order to drive adoption?
		- What are the key performance and non-performance related value drivers important to advertisers when adopting 1PD solutions? How do those value drivers vary by segment and vertical?
	- Thanks! Yes, this "1PD Understand" goal (especially the second part on value drivers) is something that Core ML should closely collaborate on, and AFAIK it's not on the radar of Core ML goals or roadmap. I understand you want me to work with Sagar + Yuhui + DS to get this on our radar, but I'm curious: do you think there are any gaps from an org/process/people perspective that are preventing us from connecting the dots?

- Daniel reschedule
	- Hi Daniel! Is it possible to reschedule our session on Feb 9 at 4pm? Here are some options that work for me:
- Feb 10 at 3pm or 4pm (preferred)
- Feb 14 at 4pm
- Feb 15 at 4pm
- Feb 16 at 4pm
- 1-1 [[Faizan Bhat]]
	- Agenda
		- Workshop
			- WP group?
			- Dinner - I'm on it
	- Workshop issues on content moderation
		- Breakout on day 1 may be difficult, because content moderation will be a key pivot point
		- If heavy moderation is needed, this changes
- 1-1 [[Chuck Jia]]
	- Agenda
		- Intros and context
		- latency - prod vs. data latency vs. data delay
	- About Chuck
		- Grad school- partial differential equations - not ML
		- Cali team since 2020
		- Mostly work on SL / SG systems
		- Leading all calibration and privacy launches and SL calibration optimization projects within our team
		- DONE Share 1pd roadmap w Chuck #[[[[Projects]]-1PD]] [[March 1st, 2023]]
		- Chuck is actively leading auto-tune platform 2.0 and we may have some dependencies for 1PD project
	- Chuck's focus / goals for this half
		- Privacy launches - mainly AggrID for now; understanding mitigations
		- SL calibration optimization - optimizing ML solutions internal to Core ML; and external to Core ML - calibration solution for CDP - VT, Reels, etc.
		- Improving core calibration technology - building autotune platform - unify and improve current calibration technology
	- Calibration team org structure
		- Currently owning most Core ML models, but want to assign that ownership to ranking model owners
		- PM - dedicated PM for calibration - Sinduja Ramanujam

	- Data latency
		- Average time within a batch of conversion data, from conversion timestamp to conversion reaching calibration training
			- 0.5 hours aggregation of hourly conversions
				- If 12am conversion reaches cali system at 1:10am, thats 70min delay
				- If 1am conversion reaches at 1:10am, that's 10 min delay
				- Average is 40 mins
			- A&A
				- From availability in AdConv to release to downstream; includess Scuba delays
			- Cali event infra joiner
				- Process where A&A conversions are joined with predictions
	- Mitigations to improve latency
		- Add 30 mins to each mitigation option to get the total time
	- Impact study document
		- Latency here is not data latency, but it's delta between timestamp of conversions to auto-tune completion time; take previous doc times and add 30 mins.
		- GAS: If we reduce latency on 1dCT ONLY, this leads to this much GAS gain; but we can apply to other models as well; therefore more fair to look at segment level adscore
	- Understanding future impact
		- p80 estimate for end of this year -
