- Meet w [[Amanpreet Kang]]
	 - Discuss workflows for shared vs public links
		 - Shared link
			 - Shared UI

			 - When recvr opens the pdf, don't get option to edit

			 - We make a copy of PDF and then share with recvr

			 - Owner will have 2 copies - original and shared

			 - Moving to 1 pdf model, where owner won't have two copies; then we can edit - August / Sept release - non LM
				 - First milestone: user will have to download locally and then edit

				 - Later in 2022 - user won't have to make a copy

			 - Not saved to local storage - in DC

			 - No edit icon

			 - Can see who shared it / unsave a file

		 - Public link
			 - Like opening a normal PDF on our app

			 - Standard UI

			 - Downloads the PDF first and saves in local storage

		 - Doc gen
			 - Initially 3 types: personalized, shared, public

			 - Personalized had a new format not supported by client apps

			 - Personalized got collapsed into shared link - but this creates some confusion

		 - Opening shared links in Standard UI
			 - Additional work - what iOS is doing - create a copy of file and show in std UI - might have security implications; 1 sprint of work

		 - Not installed work flow
			 - Shared url - same as non doc gen links; open in DC web; this is owned by DC web team - banner to download app - but the install app doesn't automatically open the PDF (ideal experience) - anyway being fixed for September
				 - Why would the user download the app?

				 - DC web team needs to change the banner

			 - Public url - 

		 - Analytics - 3 values
