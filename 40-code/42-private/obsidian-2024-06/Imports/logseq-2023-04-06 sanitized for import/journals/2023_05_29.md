- Hello! I’m in the process of creating my first YouTube channel focused on Indian mythology. I've just completed my first 8-minute video using Adobe Premiere Pro, (**[https://youtu.be/8jxtIsnJF9k**](https://youtu.be/8jxtIsnJF9k**) - unlisted), but it still needs a lot of work! Here are my specific requirements:
  
  Improved transitions: this includes trimming unnecessary pauses, implementing j-cuts and other similar transitions. This is my primary requirement
  
  Adding intro music to establish the mood
  
  Improved text/title formatting
  
  Any other small edits you may suggest based on your expertise
  
  Delivery must include source files compatible with Adobe Premiere Pro so that I can make any further changes as needed
  
  If this sounds good to you, I will go ahead and purchase your basic or standard package. Thank you very much, and I look forward to working with you! (PS: If this works out well, I also have more videos in the pipeline for which I would use your editing service).
