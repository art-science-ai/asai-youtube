	 - Creation
		 - CPT letter used by interns - Template - location, pay, hours, talent partner; talent partner signs, user does not sign

		 - Relocation addendum - create PDF, pop in template, name, location - send thru adobe Adobe Sign

	 - CPT letter
		 - Intern's school uses it for validation; then faculty is using it to verify

	 - Creation process
		 - Template is PDF - Adobe heading with text expander

		 - Add information from text expander software

		 - For relocation - just edits an existing PDF

		 - CPT - save doc and email it directly to intern

		 - Relocation - save unsinged PDF then use Adobe sign to email it to candidate

		 - Save it and attach it to workday profile

	 - End user
		 - Typically don't view on Mobile - too much information for mobile

		 - Want to view on a computer, because too much information

	 - Challenges
		 - Formatting the document in a consistent manner

		 - TODO Max limit of 2 signatures

		 - Bundling resumes and getting them to the interviewer - getting the right resume to the right interviewer

		 - Extract and save individual PDFs with the right names - HUGE problem; during school year; Sept - Nov; problem occurs every week
			 - Workaround - interviewer has to search for the right information

- [[[[Projects]]-LM User Interviews]] w [[Nolan Williams]] from [[Adobe]] internal
	 - Creation use cases
		 - Worked for companies that contracted him to create technical docs - some docs were for internal use, and some were customer facing

		 - E.g. opioid disposal company that worked with non-profits in educating about opioid disposal

		 - Two PDFs created - grant writing, and second was user guide for product itself

		 - Created via in-design and then exported to PDF; 20-30 page range

		 - Graphically oriented / 500 words per page

		 - Banners, logos, text

	 - User guide for the product
		 - Product - bag that you put unwanted opiod into, and then add tapwater and then seal and dispose safely

		 - QR Code on the bag itself that was PDF document

		 - Product was simple, but intended

	 - Structure of the doc
		 - Step by step instructions and explanation on how to use the product

		 - FAQ

		 - Typically reading on Mobile

	 - Steps taken to make it viewable
		 - Designed in a way that's easier to view

		 - Text spacing; visually organizing in a linear way

		 - Not in a reader-friendly way to avoid zooming

	 - Why PDF?
		 - PDFs are most reliable in terms of amount of people who can access it across devices, across operating systems; no distortion

		 - Alternatives: Directly designed as a site or embedded word doc. (clients prefer doc so they can edit); HTML

		 - HTML has high development time and lot of skill required to develop

	 - If you could have LM
		 - It would be useful if there is a low barrier to entry

		 - Would be great for restaurants as well

		 - Low involvement on creators

		 - How do promos work?

		 - iOS auto-open experiment

		 - Deepak slides

	 - Promos
		 - History
			 - Low intensity testing to start with - e.g. only show promo when you pinch and zoom

			 - At most once per week

			 - Most aggressive coachmark we've ever had

		 - Current rules - non AOpen
			 - Only prompt for FQ

			 - Forever, at most once per week

		 - Rules - AOpen
			 - At most once per week

			 - "Just once" gives a one month gap

		 - Promo CTR will burn-out over time

		 - Next steps
			 - As we scale AOpen, we should push out the week prompt less aggressive; go from 1 week to 2 weeks to 3 weeks to 4 weeks
