	 - Data group definition is not clear - is it a logical concept? How is it different from tags? Is it a specific SQL view? V says we should use the term "namespace". It's a collection of data we refer to in SQL.

	 - DONE Schedule meeting with Anil M, V's team on what is Data Group? E.g. how does it differ from "tags", "namespace", "offer collection", "folders"? 

	 - DONE Detailed wiki on LASA requirements; Add data group to the lookup step in slide.

	 - DONE How is it different from Ashwin's UPS export project? How do we solve mismatches between UPS and stitched datasets. There's not enough transparency. It's not deterministic, and there may be some sync issues.

	 - V's recomended flow - first two steps need more help; we need to enable discovery. Get rid of data group.
