	 - DONE Mailbox install #[[[[Projects]]-Personal-Misc]] #2023-W3
		 - I think we should return it for now. Could you please initiate the return and send me the info? (Ideally at a "box not needed" return location like Whole Foods or UPS Store if possible)

		 - This mailbox won't work with our existing post for a few reasons:

1/ There is no compatible adapter that I could find to connect this mailbox to our existing round post.

2/ Even if we could find an adapter, our post seems not sturdy enough to support the weight of this mailbox.

3/ The parts connecting our existing mailbox + post are quite rusty, making it difficult to dismantle and reconnect a new mailbox.

Ideally we would replace the entire mailbox + post. The entire kit is available on Amazon for only $30 more ( https://smile.amazon.com/Architectural-Mailboxes-6300B-10-Locking-Mailbox/dp/B0BLRFP3Z2/ ), but the post installation is more complex. I noticed that our neighbor across the street has a mailbox + post that looks almost exactly like this Amazon one — he might have some advice on this?
