	 - Core strengh - as measured by the Antranik core exercises - superman and abs - is a bit low

	 - Paraspinal muscles and abs are a little weak

	 - Maybe when I bent my back causing the spasm, the spine briefly touched a nerve; or perhaps the paraspinal muscle got strained

	 - Core = anything between neck and butt, i.e. all the trunk muscles

	 - Questions from Todd and from MSFT Andrew - what's the business case for LM

	 - Todd Qs
		 - What % of LM users are free vs paid?

		 - Do free LM users have a higher propensity to convert to paid value?

		 - Do paid LM users retain better than paid customers that don't use LM?

		 - Do users of LM have a higher overall MAU than non-LM users?

		 - Is LM consumption growing because new users are discovering it or existing LM users are consuming more documents in that view?
