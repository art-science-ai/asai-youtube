	 - Recall improvement for Meta Pay
		 - Nidhi: recall will improve when we have Stripe merchants onboarded - those have Meta Pay enabled by default

		 - As part of contract with Chase / Stripe - they will default to Meta Pay for Meta Pay users - this is called proactive checkout - Nidhi will share more details

	 - DS next steps
		 - Short term
			 - Harold + Chuan will work to unblock our House Ads MDE estimation

		 - Long term
			 - Mitali to help us establish a DS council to validate iRev analysis

			 - Meta Pay needs to share plans on improving global recall over time to justify investments
