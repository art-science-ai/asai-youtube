- [[fastai course 2020]] Lesson 3
	 - Data transforms
		 - Augmentation: create new images from an image by rotating, zooming into different places, etc.

	 - Deployment as web app
		 - Voila: provides simple GUI for notebook based web application

		 - Binder: convert Voila app into free web app (internally it builds a docker container). But it doesn't work for mobile.

	 - Problems you run into
		 - Out of domain data: data that is very different than the training data

		 - Domain shift: data for inference shifts over time to out of domain data.

	 - Start writing (like a blog)
		 - DONE Advice for better blog posts by Rachel #[[[[Projects]]-Personal-Read-later]]
