	 - Thanks for surfacing this, Ida - I've also been getting several pings on these topics. Here's how I think this should be handled

1/ Triage issue into 1PD HVR vs. non-HVR

2/ IF it is HVR, then we run through the HVR playbook. As Mandeepak mentioned, we have an existing playbook for this, which we are currently refreshing (starting first with SL Recovery sizing - which Liquan is driving)

3/ IF NOT HVR, then we need a separate playbook for this, which we don't yet have. I believe others in Core ML are currently working on this, and Sagar and I should be able to help connect the dots.
