	 - OBA / ATT mitigation
		 - Readiness is already done here

		 - All the techniques above can contribute to this and other scenarios

	 - PPML
		 - High-level goals: leverage privacy preserving techniques in ML

		 - Sub-areas
			 - AAL: Aggregated and anonymized learning

			 - PPML foundation: 
				 - A&A based offline evaluation

			 - DP - Differential Privacy - want to add noise to the system

			 - MPCML - multi-party

	 - AAL
		 - We will use A&A data as features and label

		 - Large opportunity size

		 - Want 0.3% ads score gain this year

		 - 1% ads score gain next year

	 - Using AAL for OBA mitigation
		 - OBA opts out of 3rd party data - conversion in 3pd will be lost

		 - In AAL - we know that for 1000 clicks there are 5 conversions 

		 - We actually have all the 3pd conversion data, but we just can't use it due to legal reasons

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Weiwei Shen]]
	 - About Weiwei
		 - Joined FB August 2020; started in responsibility and privacy - PPML - Sagar was PM there - then moved to Core ML

	 - About team and role
		 - DS owner of signal loss ranking - covering PPML, win-back and goal

		 - PPML - Siyi

		 - DONE Win-back track - Sylvia Sun

		 - App-track team has their own DS team

		 - CDP team has their own DS (covers all models except the one main CoreML model)

		 - Only 3-4 DS people on signal loss; whereas eng has about 100 people

		 - Very bad ratio of DS to Eng

	 - What do they do?
		 - Usually provide opportunity sizing numbers

		 - E.g. sizing for ATT de-id; how much does this increase our ads score?

	 - CoreML vs CDP
		 - CoreML owns one day CTO model - accounts for 30%+ revenue

		 - All other models owned by CDP team

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Arpit Shrivastava]]
	 - RTO days - CDP - Tuesday; MPK 62

	 - CDP vs Core ML
		 - One day click through - core ML team owns this model; foundational model; it does attribution for conversions

		 - other models owned by CDP - LAW - Long Attribution Window - 2-7 day

		 - CDP has both ranking models and attribution models

	 - Arpit role - three main projects
		 - PPML focus - downstream to signal loss

		 - AEM

		 - 3CO
