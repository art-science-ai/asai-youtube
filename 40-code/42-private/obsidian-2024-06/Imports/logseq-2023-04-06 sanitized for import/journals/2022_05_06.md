- 1-1 [[Randy Swineford]]
	 - Agenda
		 - My decision to leave Adobe
			 - I will explain why I'm making this decision, but firstly I want to thank you for being a great manager over the past year
				 - You gave me a lot of independence and scope.

				 - You trusted me to make product decisions without micro managing

				 - I could rely on you to provide support whenever needed 

				 - This trust, independence and support enabled me to grow into a Sr. PM

				 - I'm really thankful for that.

			 - Primary reason for leaving: comp
				 - Current compensation
					 - Meta: 390k

					 - +40% / +$100k

				 - Future comp
					 - Meta: target refreshers 200k / yr

					 - Adobe: got +10% base + 50k last year, 0 in prior two years

					 - Next year - I run out of initial RSU grant and comp will go down even more

				 - Conclusion
					 - Other than comp, I do really like my job - great manager, great team - eng+PM, great product

					 - My goals: saving to buy a house and start a family

					 - Staying at Adobe is not a good financial decision for me

		 - Transition plan and next steps

	 - Randy was very happy with me and happy for me; said I was a great hire and one of the best

- 1-1 [[Laurie Bryum]]
	 - Agenda
		 - I'm leaving Adobe / Meredith intro

		 - Review Phil doc

		 - Deci / wave 3 plans - heavy lift for Android

	 - Bored Yan Lacun

	 - Android scoping for Deci
		 - W1/2 - just flip the switch, no target

		 - W3 - can do all at once, but ideally split into 3 sub-waves - reason is for timing

		 - Laurie can ship 3.2 and 3.3 pretty quick, but 3.4 is more work

		 - 3.1 will get us 30% coverage

		 - 3.2 - 40% coverage

		 - 3.3 - 60% coverage

		 - 3.4 - 65% coverage

		 - 3.1 - 3.2 - no target needed

		 - 3.3 - maybe needs target
