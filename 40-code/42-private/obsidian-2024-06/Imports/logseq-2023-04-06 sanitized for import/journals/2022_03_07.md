		 - Hi Denis! Sorry for the delayed follow-up. I managed to fix the hot water issue by following your suggestion, but fixing the issue has now led to another problem. The hot water shower faucet handle has always been a bit leaky. Earlier this was not a problem because the water never go too hot, but now that I've fixed the hot water problem, the leak from the hot water faucet makes it difficult to turn it off and on. Would be great if a plumber could look into this!
