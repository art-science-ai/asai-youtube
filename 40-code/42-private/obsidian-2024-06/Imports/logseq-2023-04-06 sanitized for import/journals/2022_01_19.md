		 - LM of Acrobat Web - better description / Phase 2 - finalize new experience

		 - Tushark - complete Android roll-outs

- Performance data
	 - Our goals are set in whole number increments (e.g. <4s), but due to the way we measure in Adobe Analytics (rounded to the nearest integer), we can only report in half-second increments (e.g. <2.5s).

	 - Android server performance has slipped from <4.5s to <5.5s as we started moving several high-end devices from server to CoD

	 - Intro
		 - GTM analytics team under Maninder

		 - Support analysis for Acrobat Mobile

		 - Their team focuses on all mobile apps, but Juliane and Susan focus on DC

	 - GTM metrics
		 - Discover, try, buy, use, renew

	 - Susan's hypothesis
		 - LM will contribute to engagement and stickiness

	 - They are trying to build a Mobile DDOM dashboard

	 - Make list of questions that we want to answer
		 - What % of LM users are free vs paid?

		 - Do free LM users have a higher propensity to convert to paid value?

		 - Do paid LM users retain better than paid customers that don’t use LM?

		 - Do users of LM have a higher overall MAU than non-LM users?

		 - Is LM consumption growing because new users are discovering it, or existing LM users are consuming more documents in that view

	 - They will prioiritize questions 2 and 3 above and get back

	 - DONE Share deck and AA dashboard
