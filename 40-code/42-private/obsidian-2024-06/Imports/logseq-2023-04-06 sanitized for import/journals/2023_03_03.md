	 - Can we incorporate this into production opt-out model with MC?
		 - Concern: looking for global impact of OBA opt-out users

		 - Suppose we don't need measurement for now; we just put it into production

		 - After traffic ramps up, we do a back-test

		 - Label - risky

		 - 1-10% of global coverage for MC

	 - Options
		 - Combine w LH + Auto-fill + MC

	 - Long term plan
		 - First - train dedicated model for testing - not shipping to production

	 - Usually how we do 1PD data usage
		 - IAB dwell time and other onsite signals

		 - Wait until it is fully mature - PXFN review etc - can reach meaningful volume and recall for GAS - cover at least 10% of traffic

	 - For Meta checkout - what are the other ways?
		 - Mix all 1PD data into a single feature and label model - new product or existing product

	 - 1PD in general
		 - We want to unify 1PD across all products, and get more 1PD traffic; want to grow recall

		 - First we have LH, on top of that how much other bets can improve?

		 - Each product tries to make the curve larger and more resilient

	 - Resiliency of curve
		 - Suppose one bet goes away - how much of the curve will still remain for the whole company

	 - How to measure MC value above LH
		 - Control: 
			 - Campaigns not enrolled in meta checkout

			 - Do not add MC label

		 - Test: 
			 - Advertisers campaigns enrolled in MC

			 - Model needs to be retrained to include MC label

	 - Model production
		 - Suppose we have only link click optimization and we transition to OC

	 - Two step plan
		 - First do integration
			 - extend LH feature + label - maybe can't do backtest

			 - Separate LH vs MC feature + label - more cost - 

		 - Then do backtest to understand value

	 - Shuai message to Yuhui
		 - We help MC integrate to leverage 1pd

		 - No guarantee that we can measure gain

		 - How to measure? Backtest after ramp up to data volume

- 1-1 w [[Owen Brown]], [[Nick Strumpf]]
	 - Capacity
		 - On-time cost: training and exploration
			 - Training capacity

			 - Serving capacity is a non-issue

		 - Ongoing cost: If we ship to v0, how much more does it cost to train and maintain; this is decided by MC process; trade off ads score gain vs. serving cost

	 - Allocation
		 - Teams have entitlements - each team has some CPU and GPU

		 - Beginning of each half we fill MLRP - adscore impact, storage, etc.

		 - Entitlement not at org level - but at investment theme level

	 - Data and features team war room
		 - DIRCU allocation problems

	 - DONE Start group chat w Owen / Hayu / etc. on capacity allocation

- Meet w [[Jill Zhang]], [[Yuhui Ouyang]]
	 - About Jill
		 - Sizing work - 3PD and 1PD - developing systematic way to do this

	 - Playbook Qs
		 - Labels - can only choose 1

		 - Features - can choose multiple

		 - 

- 1-1 w [[Mandeepak Singh]]
	 - What is Shop Ads?
		 - Advertiser has both onsite an offsite Shop

		 - Destination automation - user can be taken

		 - Shop Ads team build their own conversion optimization model
