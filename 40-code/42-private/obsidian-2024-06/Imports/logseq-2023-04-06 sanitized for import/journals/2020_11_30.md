- [[Therapy]] with [[Jurgen Braungardt]]
	 - Agenda
		 - Last session issues

		 - What came up during the vacation?
			 - Inability to relax - e.g. beach day

			 - Inability to let go of goals - eg. meditation

	 - Discussed alcohol induced split personality over past 5-7 years. Pretty extreme split. 

	 - Alcoholics often have a very extreme personality shift - could that make sense?

	 - Human beings face the world through a mask. Could the rational self be a mask? If yes, it's very deeply ingrained. Or it could also be a scaffolding.

	 - Analysis paralysis is a way in which my suppressed self asserts itself by striking back.

	 - Haven't yet found a project that I can commit myself to.

	 - I'm very uncomfortable with doing nothing - perhaps because it makes me confront some emptiness in my life. WHY? What am I afraid to confront?

	 - I'm unhappy about some life choices that I've made - they were pragmatic and not meaning-driven.

	 - TODO Read Osho - my drunken provocativeness reminds Jurgen of Osho #[[[[Projects]]-Personal-Read-later]]

	 - Next time: talk about past projects (Philosophy, etc.) and future!
