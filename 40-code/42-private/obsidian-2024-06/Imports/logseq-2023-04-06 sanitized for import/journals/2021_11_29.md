	 - About Sophia
		 - Talk to Cary Mccallister for implementation; not an engineer, but knows the ins and outs of Sophia

		 - Currently it's not a live API call; not real-time; instead, based on user-behavior, we predict, and then send as part of user-profile in Sophia. Not real-time-ML. 

		 - You need to connect a model to Sophia. Sophia does not provide a model.

	 - People to talk to: Kim Tran, Carey, Aditya L

	 - Suggestions: uplift modeling

- Therapy w [[Jurgen Braungardt]]
	 - Agenda
		 - Issues w dad trying to convince me about upanainam

		 - I've learned this same behavior from my dad, and I replicate it with Rukma

	 - How to describe this behavior? Dad is not recognizing me as an independent agent, but rather just wants me to follow his lead.

	 - Dad wants me to be a part of his world, but I don't care for his world. I'm a 21st century global citizen.

	 - What I need from my father - fundamental acknowledgment of my way of thinking and feeling. "Even if you don't think our way, we're are proud of your life. I accept that you're a fully grown adult."

	 - This is the same thing I'm doing to Rukma. I need to give her the fundamental acknowledgement.
