- Content creation
	- DONE YT ideas
		- Find collaborators - for multilingual content, for production and editing
	- Why do I want to create content? I always had some creative aspirations. From the time I was and undergrad student studying philosophy and aspiring to become a philosophy professor, one of my main goals in life was to be able to engage with content that I find meaningful and am interested in and then create some output that shares that with other people and teaches them. I've always had a desire to leave my mark on the world in some way. I knew that wasn't academia at some point - when I was in my masters it became clear to me that academia is the wrong way for me to find creative expression. But I think that creating content on Youtube is a great way for me to fulfill this
