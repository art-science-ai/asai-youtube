- 1-1 with [[Apurva Birala]] on [[MS Product Management]]
	 - Not just MBA, but a lot of MS students get into PM (MS Data Science, MS CS, etc.)

	 - Internship recruiting -  CMU provides internship recruiting portal; not just applying directly to companies. This helps a lot.

	 - FT: Less of internal portal; more of external recruiting

	 - Applied to 600+ companies, and got 20+ calls

	 - Most placements in PM; very few adjacent roles (Prog Management); 10 - 20% didn't find jobs at the end
