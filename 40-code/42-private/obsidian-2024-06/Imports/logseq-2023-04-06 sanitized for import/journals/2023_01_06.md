	 - Priorities for today
		 - PSC self review - 1st draft

		 - PSC peer reviews - 1st draft for at least a couple

	 - Reflection
		 - Yesterday I did a good job of hitting my priorities. Didn't get through all - but ate the frog of processing tasks and secondary of seeking reviews.

		 - Today morning I had low motivation. Wasted the first hour browsing WP and random stuff. Why did that happen? I think I felt a little overwhelmed by the task. But I still have time this morning - so will work on my top priority.

- Misc
	 - DONE [[PSC]] provide peer feedback - thanks pending #[[[[Projects]]-Work-misc]] #2023-W4
		 - General - skipped
			 - Hi XX, thanks for reaching out to me for PSC feedback! Could you please list 1-3 things you’d like me to focus on?

This is totally optional, and it's just to ensure that I don’t overlook anything you see as a key piece of your impact this half or something you specifically want feedback on.

No worries if you decide not to share anything, but if you want to share anything please try to do so by end of today, because I plan to write peer reviews this weekend. Thank you!
