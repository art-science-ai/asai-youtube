	 - Weightlifting advice
		 - People get stuck on LPs due to working at too high intensity and not enough volume

		 - Rather than using a fixed weight or %, focus on RPE; most training should occur at lower RPE

		 - The Bridge program - bridging from LP to higher volume

		 - Barbell medicine app

		 - Lot of genetic variation in how much fat vs. muscle you will gain with caloric surplus
