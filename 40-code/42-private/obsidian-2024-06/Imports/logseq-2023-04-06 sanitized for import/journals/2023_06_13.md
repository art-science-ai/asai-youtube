	- Sha: Is feature-versioning a one-off effort, or are there future opportunities?
		- Shuai: Two future opportunities
			- FSC v2 with more features (identified features helpful to App Ads)
			- Apply to future scenarios. Either directly start feature versioning, or start with zero-out and then migrate to versioning. Need to evaluate trade-offs.
	- Hang: How to ensure that model serving logic and logging are in sync?
		- Tim: serving and logging are in sync
			- Features first get extracted in serving time
			- Placed in feature vector
			- Feature vector goes through model for inference and adlogger for logging
	- Hang: How to configure feature branch selection and ensure it's in sync with QRT?
		- Tim:
			- In serving time, branch selection is based on run-time context: system level and application level
			- Branch selection happens on terminal DUID level
