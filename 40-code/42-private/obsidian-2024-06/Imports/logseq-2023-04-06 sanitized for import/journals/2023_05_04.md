	- Hi Jill, Liquan - I wanted to follow up on Mandeepak's 1PD sizing discussion in a smaller thread. 
	  
	  There seems to be a discrepancy between the following docs, which I'd like your help to better understand:
	  
	  1/ Signal Growth Ranking 1PD HVR Strategy, which I reviewed with Jill yesterday, shows 2026 total of 2.67%: 
	  
	  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQCmq2qZhJaF6wXJOzmWjP-kJenZ6xA6b2g88pj_vJ4/edit#heading=h.dlq5m9uz2rkd
	  
	  2/ 1PD HVR SL Ranking sizing (WIP), which you shared with Mandeepak, shows 2026 total of 1.19%:

	- On a separate note, I'm going to be working out of the NYC office between Tuesday May 16 - Wednesday May 17, and would love to catch up in person if you'll be around on either of those days!
- 1PD strategy - problem 3
  collapsed:: true
	- Goal: Using web 1PD HVR signals in Signal Growth ranking models, aiming to maximize revenue for conversion optimized ads products.
	- Problem statement: ML for individual 1PD signals
	- Problem description: Each 1PD product and signal has its own unique challenges and constraints. We need to co-develop ML techniques with product teams such as ranking split by IAB vs non-IAB conversions (for Link History), on-site vs. offsite conversions (for Shop Ads), etc.
	- Collaborate with product teams to address unique challenges and constraints associated with each 1PD product and signal, such as differentiating between IAB vs non-IAB conversions for Link History, on-site vs off-site conversions for Shop Ads, etc.
