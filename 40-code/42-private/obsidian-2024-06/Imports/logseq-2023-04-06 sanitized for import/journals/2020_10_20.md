- DONE Query revenue analysis [[October 20th, 2020]]
	 - I've parsed all the Query Service obersvability data and created cost and usage reports per org for usage from 2020 april to september: https://git.corp.adobe.com/nmaddira/qs-cost/tree/master/reports

	 - If the column "data_read" is non-zero, this indicates usage of SQL explore. If the column "data_written" is non-zero, this indicates usage of SQL Prep.

	 - Please refer to these reports as the source of truth for Query Service usage in case you need this info in my absence during my PTO.
