## Prep
- Goal

			- How does this break down by products and services?
			- How does this break down by geographies?
		- What are the trends in Meta's revenue over the 4 quarters?
		- What are the key risks that META faces?

## Draft
- Why do you need a custom chatbot?
	- Chatbots are great, but they have two key limitations
		- Knowledge cut off for training data
		- Lack of specific knowledge
	- Demo: ask ChatGPT without browsing
- Determine your use case
	- Use cases and questions: Who will use this chatbot and what questions do they want to answer?
	- Data needed: What data is needed to answer these questions? Chatbots work best with text data.
- Gather documents
	- In our example, we'll use Meta
- Experiment with vanilla ChatGPT
	- No browsing - poor
	- Browsing - okay, but not good
	- With documents - works great!
	- Now, why to make a custom chatbot? If this is a repeatable use case, you don't want to keep uploading the docs every time
- Build a custom GPT
	- Give instructions
