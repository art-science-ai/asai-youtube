Steps
1. Write down your goals 
	1. Levels of goal setting
		1. Long term goals (2+ years)
		2. Medium term goals (~1 year)
		3. Short term goals (~3 months)
	2. I focus on yearly and quarterly goals. I do annual goal setting to determine 2025 goals, then I do quarterly goal setting for 2025-Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4
	3. For now let's focus on short term goals, because they are the most manageable. And once you learn to achieve your short term goals, it's easier to achieve long term goals.
	4. Brainstorm a list of potential goals across each area of your life. Here's a suggested list of life areas, but you can modify it.
		1. Work: career, business, etc.
		2. Health and wellness: diet, exercise, sleep, emotional health, etc.
		3. Home and finances: home improvement, children, finances, etc.
		4. Miscellaneous: education, hobbies, recreation, etc.
	5. Target around ~3 goals each quarter. All 3 goals may be in one area, or you may pick one goal from each area - any approach is fine. It's good to start by brainstorming a longer list, e.g. think of 3 potential goals across each area (3 x 4 = 12) then prioritize your top ~3 goals from this list for this quarter. Save your other goals for future quarters.
	6. Example goals
		1. Improve cardio fitness
		2. Learn piano
		3. 
2. Refine your goals
	1. Make your goals into [[SMART goals]]
	2. Breakdown your goals into milestones and habits
