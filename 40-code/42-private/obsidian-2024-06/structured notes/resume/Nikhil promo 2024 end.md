## 1.3. Business need for IC6 scope

The areas under Nikhil’s scope are large and complex problem spaces, where Nikhil has helped land strategies to unlock 5%+ iRev long-term, of which **1%+ iRev LRP (2025 \- 2028\) is for fully funded opportunities within Nikhil’s scope**:

1) *\[ML \- data growth\]* Landed strategies to unlock 3.8% iRev (2025 \- 2028), of which [**0.58% iRev**](#bookmark=id.cbiay6r0b0mg) opportunity is fully funded within Nikhil’s scope.  
2) *\[Consumer Journey\]* Landed strategy with [**0.7% iRev**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lXYCF0yF2rAkHW-MMp-13vdEnMOVnzQzXiFn34Obhnk/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.x3tkghw8r4bg) LRP (2025 \- 2028\) fully funded within Nikhil’s scope.  
3) *\[Signal Growth AI for Partners\]* Landed SGAI4P strategy with [\~0.89% iRev](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PtPecTU0IiX1NfSn8ArjG5mQFE9bA_EbhzvQAS6YxTc/edit#bookmark=id.ovyifmubaaic) opportunities (2025 \- 2028\) across V\&C (Value, Dynamic Ads), Business Messaging (CTX, Marketing Messaging), and Signal Growth Track 2 (Shops, Lead Ads). This is a brand new area and only partially funded.

Realizing this opportunity will require significant further investment across a large number of X-Monetization priorities. Continuing to drive strategy and execution across Signal Growth, AI, V\&C, and Business Messaging priorities at the leadership level is of IC6+ level complexity, which Nikhil has already demonstrated.

## 1.4. Strong support from XFNs

Nikhil has strong support for promotion from several senior stakeholders who endorse that he has been operating at IC6 level. They note Nikhil's high levels of thought leadership, technical expertise, and ability to navigate complex cross-org strategies:

* NAME, M2 Eng in ORG: \<\<INSERT QUOTE\>\>  
* NAME, IC7 Eng in ORG: \<\<INSERT QUOTE\>\>  
* …

Nikhil also has strong support for promotion from 9 stakeholders that are at least one level above him, has positive PSC feedback from 20+ stakeholders, and has received 70+ \#thanks for his contributions from 45 people.

## 1.5. Nikhil’s development areas

Through his IC5 \-\> 6 journey, Nikhil’s key development areas have been the combination of **moving fast** and **navigating ambiguous XFN scenarios**. While he initially struggled to quickly drive decisions involving multiple senior XFN stakeholders, he has shown significant development in these areas as evidenced by his recent stakeholder endorsements:

* *“Nikhil's ability to handle complex cross-org collaborations is at an IC6 level”* ([Tosh Rayadhurgam](mailto:toshr@meta.com) M1 EM, SG Ranking)  
* *“Nikhil took an ambiguous product idea and moved fast to secure buy-in from VP level XFN leadership, alignment across multiple functions and orgs and navigated ambiguous PXFN landscape”* ([Candice Mizushima](mailto:cmizushima@meta.com) IC7 PMM, GenAI)
