### Mission & Vision

- **Our mission is to democratize coding by empowering everyone**—from professional developers to complete newcomers—to build software better, faster, and more collaboratively, thereby unlocking their creativity. We envision a future where software creation is as simple as writing a document or social post.
    
- To achieve this, we will build an AI Engineering agent that **deeply understands context, code, and user needs**; it will **integrate seamlessly** across the entire development process—from learning and ideation to deployment—so both experts and non-developers can innovate with minimal friction.
    
- **Short Term** focus: Improve developer productivity within Meta; in the medium term also support teams that aren’t strictly “engineering teams,” such as data analysts and PMs.
    
- **Long Term** vision: Expand both internally and externally to empower a broader global community.

- **Product Managers & Designers**: Occasionally need light code modifications or prototypes; require a simple interface, plain-language explanations, and safer sandboxing.
    
- **IT / Operational Staff**: Might need basic scripting to automate workflows or maintain internal tools, focusing on reliability and clarity of generated code.
    

### 3. External Developers (Long-Term Goal)

- **Professional Developers**: Wide variety of languages and frameworks; expect best-in-class code completion, debugging, security, and privacy.
    
- **Independent / Open-Source Developers**: Desire flexibility, open standards, easy integration with GitHub/GitLab, and robust community support.
    
- **Novices & Learners**: Need tutorials, guided experiences, and simple “explain” features to gradually build skill and confidence.
