## Overview

- My setup for Niri + Noctalia shell on NixOS
- I am currently using GNOME + PaperWM and want to migrate to Niri + Noctalia shell while staying as close to existing setup as possible (e.g. using PaperWM keybinds)

## Setup

- The configuration is split into multiple files:
  - `default.nix`: main entry point, imports other modules
  - `niri.nix`: loads upstream default KDL and appends Noctalia overlay binds
  - `default-config.kdl`: pinned upstream Niri default config (v25.08)
  - `noctalia.nix`: configures Noctalia shell
  - `fuzzel.nix`: configures the Fuzzel application launcher
- `niri.nix` adds Noctalia startup and overlay binds on top of the upstream defaults

## Problems

- Battery indicator appears on desktop
  - Status: unresolved
  - Next step: check Noctalia shell options for disabling battery widget in `noctalia.nix`
- Hotkeys showing up in super + ? are not matching
  - Status: expected behavior
  - Note: the overlay lists all actions, not just the bound ones
- We need to map all the normal hotkeys from PaperWM or use defaults
  - Status: using upstream defaults now
- Large empty space between window top and taskbar
  - Status: unresolved
  - Next step: decide whether to adjust niri layout gaps or Noctalia panel spacing
- Clipboard management is not working properly
  - Status: partially addressed
  - Note: `wl-clipboard` and `copyq` are installed via `modules/home/keyboard/clipboard.nix`
  - Next step: decide if we should add a `wl-paste --watch` service for PRIMARY -> CLIPBOARD sync
