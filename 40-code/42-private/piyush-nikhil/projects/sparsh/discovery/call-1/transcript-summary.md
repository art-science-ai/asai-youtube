# Transcript summary

**Client:** Sparsh Hospice
**Date:** Discovery call - Patient services workflow
**Participants:** Counseling department representative, Home care team representative

## Client context

- Sparsh provides hospice and palliative care services in Hyderabad
- Four main service verticals: inpatient hospice care, home care, living will services, and outpatient consultation
- Counseling department serves as the first point of contact for all inquiries
- Multi-disciplinary team including counselors, doctors, nurses, and social workers
- Volume is approximately 10 inquiries per day, up to 300 per month

## Current situation

**Existing tools and processes:**
- Personal notebook for initial inquiry recording (manual, paper-based)
- Paper pre-assessment/inquiry forms for potential cases
- Pwens (https://www.pwens.com) - hospice management system for registered patient records
- WhatsApp groups for coordination between teams
- Phone, email, and walk-in inquiries (60-70% through word of mouth)

**Manual workflows or pain points:**
- Initial notes taken in personal notebooks, not digitized
- Pre-assessment forms are paper-based, filed but not in digital system
- Pwens data entry happens after conversations, takes approximately 15 minutes total per intake
- Home care team takes notes during visits then enters data later due to network issues
- Prioritization of home visits is ad hoc and subjective
- No formal system for triaging patient priority levels
- Doctors constantly asking which zones to visit - lack of scheduling system
- Emergency vs non-emergency assessment requires medical judgment but made by non-medical counselors

**What's working well:**
- Flexible appointment system - not rigid, can accommodate walk-ins
- Quick response times - counselor responds immediately to inquiries
- Good documentation in Pwens once patients are registered
- Pwens accessible via mobile app for field teams

## Challenges

**Primary problems to solve:**
- No digital capture of initial inquiries - valuable data lost in personal notebooks
- Duplicate data entry (notebook, then paper form, then Pwens)
- No automated priority scoring system for home visits
- No integrated system linking patient care to potential donor interests
- Manual transcription of conversations into system notes
- Network issues preventing real-time data entry during home visits
- No formal criteria for medical prioritization - doctors need to provide framework

**Impact of these problems:**
- Lost potential donor connections when families express interest during care
- Time spent on manual data entry (50 minutes per day for counselor)
- Inefficient resource allocation for home visit prioritization
- Information silos between counseling, home care, and donor management
- Risk of losing insights when staff turnover occurs

**Urgency and priority:**
- High: Donor interest capture during patient care is a missed opportunity
- Medium: Data entry efficiency could save staff time
- Medium: Visit prioritization framework needed for better resource utilization

## Goals

**Desired outcomes:**
- Digital inquiry capture system accessible to all team members
- Automated priority scoring framework based on medical criteria
- Integration between patient care system (Pwens) and donor management system
- Mobile-friendly data collection that works offline
- Automated transcription of conversations to structured notes

**Success metrics:**
- Reduced time from inquiry to registration
- Increased capture rate of potential donor interests
- Improved home visit scheduling efficiency
- 100% of inquiries digitized and searchable

**Timeline considerations:**
- Willing to implement in phases
- Need to prioritize most impactful solutions first

## Constraints

**Budget considerations:**
- Not explicitly discussed, but looking for prioritized high-impact solutions

**Technical constraints:**
- Existing Pwens (https://www.pwens.com) system that may be extended or integrated with
- Network connectivity issues during home visits need offline capability
- Staff may not be comfortable with extensive typing on mobile devices
- Need user-friendly interfaces for non-technical staff

**Decision-making process:**
- Family-run organization (Dr. Subramanian involved)
- Willing to involve relevant stakeholders in discussions

**Key stakeholders:**
- Counseling department (first point of contact)
- Home care teams (nurses, social workers, doctors)
- Donor management team
- Management/leadership team

## Opportunities

**Potential solutions discussed:**
- AI-powered conversation recording that auto-populates forms
- Mobile app with offline capability for field data collection
- Digital inquiry forms integrated with Pwens
- Priority scoring system based on medical criteria from doctors
- "Interested in donation" checkbox in Pwens with automated follow-up reminders
- Death anniversary reminders for donor engagement

**Low-hanging fruit:**
- Add "interested in donation" field to Pwens with follow-up workflow
- Digital pre-assessment form to replace paper version
- Automated WhatsApp/email reminders for important dates (birthdays, death anniversaries)

**Larger transformation opportunities:**
- Full CRM system integration with patient care records
- End-to-end digital workflow from inquiry to care to donor engagement
- AI-assisted documentation and note-taking
- Predictive analytics for donor conversion from patient families

## Next steps

**Follow-up items:**
- Discuss donor management workflow separately
- Review current donor data capture and management processes
- Evaluate Pwens extension capabilities vs new system implementation
- Engage doctors to define medical prioritization criteria framework

**Information needed:**
- Current donor management process and tools
- Pwens system capabilities and integration options (https://www.pwens.com)
- Budget allocation for technology improvements
- Staff training and change management considerations

**Decision timeline:**
- Need to prioritize 1-2 most impactful solutions to implement first
- Will review options and get back after internal discussion
