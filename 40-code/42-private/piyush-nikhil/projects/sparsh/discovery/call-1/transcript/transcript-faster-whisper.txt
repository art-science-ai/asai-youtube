 Okay so I guess we talked about that you explained that there are four main
 verticals of services in sparsh one is the inpatient hospice care one is home
 care one is the living will and one is outpatient consultation. Okay so we can
 start and with whichever one I think you are from the counseling side right
 okay and so which of these services does that connect to? Everything.
 My department is the face of the organization. So whoever comes they come to us first for the inquiry
 right now when I was talking about the inquiry only. People come with a lot of doubts. Some people they don't even know what it is.
 The enquiries that actually come first will be like very small percentage. A lot of people do come just to talk to us
 understand some people think that there is some active treatment is there. Okay they just want to know.
 A lot of people do come and visit us. First friend of his will guide them to us.
 If not me, my team will talk. We will understand depending on the situation.
 If it is in the end of life care really patient is matter of hours or days or months so we will ask them for the admission.
 For the admission we need doctor's permission so we will again update the complete inquiry.
 We have an inquiry form. We will fill that form, take all the details and I will put it to the doctor.
 Whoever is there at the center at that time we will explain the case to them.
 And then they will tell whether it is suitable for admission or not.
 If admission is allowed then we will put the admission process into the inquiry form and everything like you know the process goes.
 The patient will come. This for the inpatient? Inpatient that's right.
 So inpatient mostly we stick to the end of life care only. Okay.
 So then sometimes because here we don't take any cases that are under active treatment.
 The treatment has to stop. There are some cases where treatment is going on simultaneously.
 Finally it needs for the patient pain and symptom management.
 We need some help over there you know. Many kind of support.
 Some they want some wound management. Some are a bit wooden.
 Some they need cars that run on adjacent consolidators.
 But all those cases we will put into the home care.
 Okay. So there again the inquiry will be there.
 Home care that I will decide and any doctor will talk to Ishwar and we will decide and then we will put it into the home care.
 And the thing will be transferred to the home care department depending on the zones, whichever zone.
 Based on the geography. That's right.
 So that team take it as a new case and put more on next day or by the evening or by next morning.
 They'll call the concerned patient's family.
 They'll ask them when do they visit, what to do and also they will go.
 First visit if doctor is available doctor will go.
 Otherwise the team will visit. That's the staff nurse, social worker.
 And they will understand the need as in the situation.
 If the doctor's need is there then they will inform the doctor.
 The doctor will also visit.
 Okay.
 So that service will continue as long as they work.
 If the situation gets really bad they will only transfer the case to the IP.
 Okay.
 The home care will continue as long as the family needs us.
 Okay.
 Sometimes after going there also we realize that intensity is more than the family is thinking.
 Sometimes it can be really serious they are not realizing.
 They are still thinking of active treatment.
 Can we do that?
 Can we do that?
 So there our team of doctors will go explain them why is it important for the patient to
 just focus on the quality of the life now.
 Yeah.
 They are looking for the treatment.
 All the sponsoring we do.
 Our social worker she will again report to me about anything that we do take.
 You know online sessions.
 We have psychologists.
 They do visit home.
 Okay.
 A lot of times I have a lot of online sessions.
 It might be content sessions also.
 For the home care patients.
 Sometimes they don't even tell the patient what is happening.
 The patient is not even aware of diagnosis.
 Okay.
 Suppose mother is sick and she is not taking care.
 Father doesn't know what is happening.
 So when a family there is one person who is taking care of everything.
 But what happens patient and this cause will be asking so many questions.
 So there we need to counsel the family also.
 You know children who are taking care.
 Why is it important for the patient to know what is happening to them?
 Because if that is not there it will interfere with the care management of the patient.
 So the patient wants to go to a hospital.
 They want to be in the activity because they don't know what is happening to them.
 So we tell them why is it important for them to know that actual what is happening to them.
 Breaking bad news is important.
 All those situations our team will work or in the end.
 So depending on that.
 So you talked about just now the inpatient side and the home care side.
 And what about outpatient?
 Outpatient also at the process is the same.
 They come.
 They come to us.
 The patient is not in Hyderabad.
 They are somewhere you know or somewhere in other parts of the city.
 Other parts of the state.
 So they would have just come here for some you know medication.
 So then the family will come.
 Then we will put them into the OP or patient.
 So then we will connect them to the nursing team.
 They will give them what kind of medication is required.
 They have a separate book.
 They will maintain the law on that.
 And then they will take the medication and go.
 But they will take it for 10 days depending on the situation.
 So again they will come back.
 But we do counseling also.
 Counseling also yes.
 Counseling goes for the department person of everything.
 So basically these are the different levels of care.
 Like outpatient is the lowest level.
 Then home care is the next level.
 Then inpatient.
 Correct.
 Can you tell me a little bit about like the initial process.
 Like before somebody comes into any of these services.
 Like when they first made contact.
 How does that work.
 Usually what are the methods by which they contact you.
 Do they send you e-mail or do they make a phone call.
 And then what are the next steps that you have.
 So usually whoever comes here 60 to 70% are through the waterfall.
 The beneficiaries would have told them.
 So they will just walk in.
 Most of the things are walking.
 So before they walk in they don't even make a phone call.
 Not required.
 We do get phone calls.
 We do get like bank earnings.
 I do get mails.
 But it is not that it has to come like that only.
 But if it comes like that then.
 But the next step is you ask them to come in.
 Yeah.
 So certain times today only I had one inquiry.
 This is from Vijay Vada.
 Yeah.
 So I can't ask them just to come here and talk to you.
 For them I talk to them over the phone itself.
 First I will ask them are you from Hyderabad.
 It's possible for you to come.
 And because if they are asking for admission.
 Doctors have to see the notice boards and all.
 Sometimes if that situation is out of the city somewhere far.
 So you have to make some appointment for that.
 Or they just call you.
 Whenever they come with a statement.
 They are not that rigid like you know.
 So whenever inquiry comes.
 Because my style of working is I will be responding very quickly.
 I don't believe in keeping things.
 And you are like the first point of contact.
 Yeah right.
 So the ocean counsellor and the psychological team.
 As a whole is the first.
 And as madam rightly put they are the patient's voice.
 Okay.
 Right.
 And then so just to summarize madam's thing.
 So you ask the question how do we get the girls.
 What are the mechanism of getting the equities.
 Yeah.
 What are the routes for them to get the equities.
 So call is one.
 Mail is taken.
 Word of mouth.
 Which is they will just walk in.
 Yeah.
 Even before walking they will just call and ask.
 Hey what is your Google address pin location.
 Something like that right.
 And if somebody mails you I guess you would just tell them to call or to call.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Again as I said if they are from outside I personally call them and talk to them.
 If they are from Hyderabad I will see if possible for you to come over.
 Come down and talk to us.
 Okay.
 I prefer meeting the person and talking to them.
 Of course we are not rigid that you know.
 Yeah right.
 You have to like if you go to some healthcare institute they will say your appointment
 is at that time.
 Yeah.
 So we say if somebody goes when can we come.
 Yeah.
 So overall we are not that rigid because we have a volume is also not that much.
 Okay.
 We don't get like 60, 70 equities coming and everything.
 Got it.
 It's hardly 10 or 15 max.
 That's it.
 Got it.
 So what is the point at which you start like writing down some notes about some individuals.
 Immediately.
 Personally.
 In the first phone call.
 First phone call.
 Okay.
 Because I believe in maintaining record doesn't matter whether they are a case or not.
 Because in my record I also write these are not our cases.
 I have diverted them to somewhere else you know.
 Some would be in active patients like they need rehab.
 Okay.
 So I'm diverted to rehab.
 Some would be in active treatment.
 They would just come like you know because the medication is very expensive for us.
 Can you do as a chemo and all.
 Okay.
 So those also I have complete record of each and every person who visits me.
 And how do you make these records?
 In the notebook.
 I have a notebook.
 Okay.
 I maintain a notebook.
 Okay.
 Got it.
 So first like a patient contacts you as an initial point of contact.
 You talk to them and then you make a record of it.
 Yeah.
 You have a notebook.
 Yeah.
 And then suppose like the next step is like let's say they want to become a home care
 patient right.
 Yeah.
 Then what happens is the next.
 Is there some point at which we create like a formal record of this patient?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So first initially I noted in my record if it is going to converted into other home
 care.
 Okay.
 Then we have an inquiry form.
 That's the second thing.
 And inquiry form.
 This is a paper form.
 Not digital.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Pre-assessment form.
 Yeah.
 Pre-assessment form.
 That we'll take.
 Then after that when it is converted.
 So when the pre-assessment is before the initial conversation.
 When the conversation is started.
 Okay.
 That time itself.
 I'll make my notes.
 Okay.
 When it is getting converted into IP, OP.
 I mean OP.
 You know.
 IP and home care.
 We have something called PVS.
 Something called what?
 PVS.
 So PVS is a hospice management system.
 Say it again?
 Hospice management system.
 No.
 The first thing.
 PVS.
 PVS is a doctor for medicine.
 D-V-E-N-N.
 P-W-E-N-S.
 P-W-E-N-S.
 P-W-E-N-S.
 Okay.
 So this is a software.
 Yeah.
 Where we have patient records.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Anything related to patient.
 They are diagnosed.
 And we registered the patients.
 So madam took the assessment.
 Initial recording happened there.
 Yeah.
 And then we convert them.
 Or we add them.
 Okay.
 And then we convert them.
 Or we add them.
 Register them into our verticals.
 As per the needs.
 So I guess there's two outcomes.
 Right.
 She's saying sometimes the patient calls.
 And then you determine that.
 Hey, this is not the right fit.
 Then you don't register them.
 That you just have in your notebook.
 But then if you forward them to home care.
 Or in patient.
 Yeah.
 We put them in.
 Okay.
 General enquiries.
 I don't have my report.
 But that is not digital.
 I don't have my report.
 And what is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 What is this pre-assessment?
 And what is this pre-assessment?
 I don't have any.
 It's not digital.
 I'm a bit manual.
 What is this pre-assessment form you mentioned?
 I can show you that.
 Okay.
 But at what stage is that before the P-men?
 Before P-men.
 Yeah.
 Before P-men.
 Yeah.
 Before P-men.
 First I'll ask them.
 What is that requirement?
 What did they want?
 For....
 Some are just generally randomly.
 They just came for inquiry.
 No way connected to us.
 So I'll just make a note in my notebook.
 The so and so person has come.
 I'll make sure that I take their name and all.
 This is the first step.
 Okay, okay.
 This is the second step.
 Okay, and you ask the patient to fill this?
 No, no, I fill it.
 Oh, you fill it? Okay.
 And then what do you do with these forms?
 We are not filing it just to know that how many, you know,
 employees have come from IPOP.
 Okay, IPOP. Everything will be on this.
 Okay.
 So what I also understand is that this clarifies because there are so many departments,
 it's a multi-discount routine, right?
 Yeah.
 If you have nurses out there, if you have nurses and everybody,
 it clarifies the name that what goes though,
 need of the patient to get onboard your vehicle.
 Right, it's like a triage almost.
 Yeah.
 But currently you're not, like, digitizing these.
 No.
 You use them to determine what is the next step.
 Yeah.
 And then you file it even in your records.
 Okay.
 Right, right.
 I mean, that's the kind of things I'm just trying to understand.
 Like, what is the current process?
 And like, you know, whether it is home care
 or whichever hospice, home care or OP.
 Yeah.
 Then these three things, the OP one, these two will go to...
 What is the fourth one?
 This is respite.
 If I have asked them to visit hospitals.
 Okay, that means they're not coming here.
 It's like you sent them external.
 Okay, got it.
 So these two will go to...
 PIVAS.
 Hospice care and...
 So once the patient get onboarded PIVAS,
 this is basically the software where we have the patient record.
 Right.
 Like, every round, every counseling.
 Right?
 That will be a complete record of every day.
 Yes.
 After doctors report and this will also be completed.
 After patients got onboarded with us.
 So how do you populate this PIVAS record?
 Thanks.
 You do it yourself or you call them
 and ask them for...
 Let's say it's a home care patient.
 I do it because once I have taken the inquiry
 I have decided that the patient has to read...
 Yeah.
 Every counselor does that.
 Yeah.
 So nurses are whatever doctors record they will do.
 Suppose the doctor could be
 once it is confirmed that it is in patient.
 Maybe let's take the example of home care.
 Home care. So once it is confirmed as home care
 I'll put it in the group that you know
 he'll take it forward to that group.
 In what group?
 We have home care groups and our teams are...
 Oh, okay.
 Like WhatsApp groups where you communicate.
 Yes.
 So then after that I would be going to PIVAS
 I have my ID
 I'll go there.
 Then I will report whatever I have spoken.
 So the doctor when they talk to them
 I'll probably talk to them in medical.
 Right.
 Medical information.
 Basic medical information.
 What was the treatment they have taken till now?
 What is the condition now?
 And the family background.
 I'll upload it in the PIVAS from my side.
 Okay.
 All the social counsellors are allowed to
 register.
 We have all the IDs.
 So any inquiry I take
 other info care or
 So let's say
 other social counsellors.
 So they are also allowed to register.
 So in short...
 Do you know like on average
 if you were to guess like how much time
 it takes you to
 fill in this PIVAS form?
 Yeah but the entire process might take
 15 minutes because first I will be talking
 to them making my notes and then
 you know the same life form will come.
 Then if it is an IP then I'll go to
 doctor, get their permission.
 After that I'll be going into the PIVAS
 and then I'll be entering there also.
 Okay.
 So once you start entering
 Yeah I guess I'm wondering
 how long just for the
 entering the forms.
 So you just like refer to whatever
 notes you wrote down and
 put it in the PVNs.
 I guess one of the technologies
 that is becoming popular these days
 is using AI to
 automatically...
 For example if I was
 having a consultation with you
 and we had a recording for this
 at the end of the conversation
 it could automatically give you the
 PVNs form
 and populate it.
 That can happen.
 And do you know what is
 approximately the
 volume of these conversations
 you have per day or per month?
 It depends again it depends from person to person.
 Somebody would come with a complete
 acceptance. They just need to
 understand whether they are taking
 the case or not. They don't know everything
 but there are certain times where they don't know
 anything.
 Can we show on average 40 minutes each family?
 Sometimes. 40 minutes
 for the conversation.
 And then after that 40 minutes
 you spend maybe 10 minutes
 writing this thing and putting it in the PVNs.
 And on average
 how many
 intakes do we have daily
 or monthly?
 Per day sometimes maximum
 10.
 Including all concerts we have 10 per day.
 Again
 some days not to that
 because we have more on Saturdays.
 So maybe you have
 up to 300 per month?
 One month yes.
 More than that
 so some cases
 we don't
 write anything because they just come
 and talk to us and
 a lot of people do visit.
 How do people get converted?
 I guess the important stage
 is when you have to make
 the actual record before that
 is just for your own reference.
 So then what happens next?
 Suppose let's take the example
 of home care.
 So you have this initial conversation
 then you determine
 that they are a home care patient
 and then you created this PVNs
 record.
 Not just if each one will be a good person
 to explain.
 What happens is
 when I say what we do with the patient
 there are so many logistical
 part which is related to that.
 Why don't you explain
 ma'am gives you that this is
 a home care inquiry that we do.
 So after ma'am spoke with them
 after that initial inquiry
 we receive a message from ma'am
 in an official
 WhatsApp group.
 So from that
 we call them
 we call them
 we write as the results.
 Some patients may not require
 immediate response
 but some patients may need
 immediate response
 according to their symptoms.
 Immediate means like same day?
 No.
 So nurse or counselor
 will call them.
 So when you say we call them
 you have to tell who calls.
 How do you know which one means
 immediate response?
 Some patients have severe pains.
 Some patients have many
 bleeding wounds.
 How will you know that?
 We read ma'am's notes
 then we call the patient's
 family.
 So when you say you read ma'am's notes
 is the T1's notes
 or something else?
 Yes.
 Not in the
 inquiry form.
 This one?
 Wait, but how do you
 read it?
 I think you are not telling clearly.
 Some confusion.
 So what happens is that
 we don't know
 actually until we go there.
 There is some confusion
 even we are facing.
 We need some help over there.
 So some people say that
 emergency for me may not be emergency for you.
 Right.
 I might be thinking that
 but what happens is that
 there may not be emergency, medical emergency.
 It may not be.
 So right where our team can go
 visit there may be doctor may not be there.
 Nuts can go, we understand.
 Sometimes it can be just a panic of the family.
 So that's what happens.
 So after that there will be a situation
 because doctor's visits are prioritized
 based on the decisions.
 Tell me what happens between
 when you have the intake
 and the first contact they have with the doctor.
 I think that's over there.
 Then I will forward it to him.
 It's an unofficial group.
 We have two home care groups
 where three zones are divided there.
 So he will put it there.
 Suppose the inquiry has come to new city.
 So then what happens?
 He will alert the new city.
 You have a new visit here.
 He will do that.
 So they will be noted.
 Today we have a new visit inquiry has come.
 So my effort would be
 to try to at least call them by evening
 or by next time morning.
 At least they will understand that
 our inquiry has to be just as people have called.
 So they will call and understand.
 Sometimes whatever patient will be still in the hospital.
 They won't have got disturbed.
 So they will make sure that patient is in the hospital.
 They will ask them at what time do you want to come.
 What is the condition?
 Is a patient in real pain?
 What is the situation?
 Sometimes it will be
 as he said it will be
 like patient will be screaming in pain.
 A lot of symptoms are there.
 So then they will immediately prioritize.
 Every new visit would be prioritized.
 Whether doctor should be there or not.
 That is the call that they will take.
 And nurse only.
 So what are the options?
 Either doctor is there for the visit
 or a nurse is there.
 Nurse and social worker by default.
 Doctors we have two doctors
 but we have six zones out there.
 So that is the reason where we have to
 evaluate and segregate which zone.
 At least every new visit we will try to
 make sure that doctor is there.
 Again depending on the priorities.
 Because just now I got an inquiry.
 I told the doctor to go there.
 Because the patient needs help
 in terms of heart.
 But it sounds like you don't have any
 formal system for doing this prioritization.
 Like it's kind of ad hoc.
 Like based on your understanding.
 You will make a judgment.
 And doctor also keeps asking them
 which zone I have to go.
 Which I have a problem like that should not be there.
 There should be some system where it has to be prioritized.
 Where maybe at the beginning of the day
 you can make a schedule.
 And each doctor and each team will know.
 These are the symptoms
 where I will be in the inquiry.
 I will be posted with this phone care.
 These are the symptoms.
 So that would automatically come under priority.
 If I put under certain symptoms
 that is no longer a priority.
 By default you should know.
 Sometimes might be there will be something.
 But I think the problem is that
 you are not able to make this assessment.
 You need like a nurse or doctor
 to make this assessment.
 Either like they need to
 probably like once you have a call with them
 the next step should be that
 the nurse or doctor has a call to do.
 The idea was we had a discussion
 with doctors also the other day.
 I had a discussion where I have to ask them
 to give us certain things for the doctors.
 Like a criteria.
 Exactly.
 I am not a medical person.
 When I listen to them
 everything might look like an emergency.
 So doctor has to give us a criteria.
 All these things are matching to this criteria.
 Then we say it is a high priority.
 In parents also in the inquiry also
 there should be a column where
 this is a priority business.
 That system is not there yet.
 I think that framework is something
 we need to work on.
 So fine.
 The way in which ad hoc
 you determine the priority
 and then you put this new patient
 in your queue and maybe tomorrow
 or day after you are going to go
 and have a visit with them.
 So what happens in that first
 so in that first visit
 maybe it is only a nurse
 and social worker or maybe there is also
 a doctor there.
 So I think maybe
 let me clarify
 which part of this I am more interested
 in is what software
 can and can't help with.
 Software cannot help with how you
 provide care to the patient.
 That part I think maybe I am less
 interested in exactly what care
 can you provide. What software can
 help with is how to manage
 the flow of information from
 you guys have so many different teams
 how to make sure there is a proper
 record of information
 and what is the flow of information
 from one place to the next
 structure for that.
 That is mostly what I am trying to understand.
 Suppose if this inquiry
 can be digitalized and you can
 give access to not everybody
 to her tech and people
 on that with doctors.
 Or if it could even be integrated
 into your P-VAN system
 or like something.
 Which ever way.
 Try to digitalize it
 from the P-VAN system.
 So then you guys
 can make the home visit.
 So then do you do any kind of
 intake there or are you trying to
 collect more information.
 A lot of intake happens there because that is where
 the social worker especially and nurse
 they are actually meeting the patient.
 So complete medical records, the pictures
 will be taken, it will be uploaded in the P-VAN
 and the social worker takes a complete note
 of them like talking to the family
 patient may not be in a condition to talk.
 So they should talk to the financial family
 what are the patients needs
 so a lot of things
 they are married and have siblings
 children what are they doing
 complete recording.
 A lot of intake happens there.
 So like how do they do it.
 Do they first write it in a notebook
 and then come back to the office and enter it in the P-VAN
 or do they carry some luck.
 Because sometimes what the problem
 they are facing is network issues.
 Actually they can open their icons
 and do that but if it is not possible
 they are making a note in the notes
 okay.
 One simple solution I don't know
 if it will be feasible or not
 like I said earlier these days there is
 software that if you just
 like on your phone if you can press the record button
 you have this conversation
 then once you come back
 we can automatically give you
 like that entire notes
 and then also we can try to
 format it in whichever ways
 helpful you can say that here
 these are the main sections and the main points
 and summary and stuff.
 So right now
 it's pretty ad hoc
 so maybe when they are there
 typically do they
 like take some notebook
 or how does it work.
 So typically it should be that
 they should open their pad or
 phone and register on that one.
 So this P-VAN has like a
 phone app
 but maybe it's not very user
 friendly and also not everyone
 types so fast like
 even for me right I was like
 I need to collect some information
 and if I had to talk to you on simultaneously
 they type this out.
 For me my department how it goes
 is
 99% it is after the visit
 but that's what is happening.
 So it's fresh in your mind.
 Yeah there may be a note in their book
 because there may not be possible to sit and write the whole thing
 so there's people somewhere
 and they go back home in the evening
 that's what they do.
 Nurses because they have to take some pictures
 of the files and all documents
 they have to be in it there.
 So I think mostly
 of the past medical records
 of the patient they take photos of that
 and then they also ask
 some questions and then
 they upload these photos
 onto this P-VAN system
 and whatever they remember from the notes
 they write that also into the P-VAN system.
 Okay.
 And do they enter the details of
 what other
 kinds of care you provide
 other than just giving medications?
 Just counseling.
 Okay.
 No I mean like medical.
 Everything.
 When we say everything
 you have to tell that
 what exact activity
 you have been here since the
 management.
 Okay.
 So you may do breakfast in here too.
 Yes.
 And do you make
 a record of that also?
 Yes.
 So you note like all the activities that you did?
 Yes.
 If we did catheterization on that day
 we just enter the details
 in the P-VAN system.
 Okay.
 So then like suppose
 you are going to a home care patient
 and you want to know
 the history, right?
 How do you do that?
 Do you open like the P-VAN application
 and look at that?
 Yes.
 But is it always the same person
 goes to the same home care?
 Most of the time the team
 will be the same.
 But suppose like on one day
 they are like absent
 like from work.
 So some new person is going.
 Then how would they?
 Unless there is something
 the person is only you.
 The same team will go.
 But even if it is the same team
 sometimes you may not exactly remember
 the history of all the patients.
 The P-VAN record is there.
 So they might check that?
 Yes.
 Even like you know I go back
 to the home care and check my social
 classes note also.
 So basically when
 we have any
 visit or consultation with the patient
 first the doctor will see
 the existing record
 and look at like quickly what is the history
 and then whatever happens today
 they will update it in that record.
 Okay.
 And then is there anything that
 happens between the
 visits like are there any phone
 or video discussions?
 Sometimes they can ask for other requirements also
 like they want a card, they want a
 review of the wheelchairs also
 anything, any other help also we
 provide them.
 And the social counselors
 the zone number will be shared with the family.
 What is the zone number?
 Whatever the home care team, contact number.
 Oh the phone number.
 So they will be in touch sometimes
 there is an emergency they keep calling them
 and by default
 depending on the parity
 or once in 10 days our team do visit.
 Okay.
 So they can call them
 after 2 days, 3 days
 anything over the phone the doctor is there
 doctor will guide them okay
 they just change this medication that
 the dose and all that.
 So if they call and the doctor says
 okay you can change this medication
 do they again go and update the record?
 Yes yes because the medication is very
 important right?
 So the medication probably is the most
 important thing if you make any changes
 to that then you have to get a record.
 Okay.
 Okay sorry
 I just prepared one or two
 let me see if I have anything
 Is there anything else important
 that we missed about this
 process?
 So you are trying to basically help us in creating an app
 that would be...
 I think right now we are trying to understand
 the current workflow
 on both sides one is on this
 patient side then also want to understand
 like on the fundraising and donor side
 and then like I don't think
 we have the capability to build
 some solution for everything
 but we are trying to prioritize
 like what are the one or two things that
 would be the most
 impactful to be able
 to solve using some technology
 and for that like build so either
 it could be like build some extension
 of the existing system
 or like build some new system
 like you know like the ones I described
 for doing this stuff
 I'll start with one sec
 what was the question
 Yeah I guess that was the main point
 I think the last thing I just want to ask
 is like yeah you guys have
 any suggestions
 out of this entire process
 like which of it feels like the most
 I don't know
 kind of like frustrating or painful
 team today what like you think
 could be like improved
 in this entire process that you
 what is causing like the most
 confusion or like
 difficulty right now
 if anything maybe you can say like hey
 everything is working smoothly like that's also fine
 Because we don't have any different
 I suppose say home care people
 when they visit home
 a lot of people do tell us
 that they would like to donate
 I always think I want something
 on record that you know
 that the people in social classes
 would like to donate in the future
 because right now the debt
 would have gone for a commitment visit
 so I want some place
 maybe if you could have a field
 in the pvents that says something
 like interested in donation
 and you can check that box
 and then when we do the like
 donor fundraising thing
 process where after three months
 or you set some period
 then you reach out to them
 because that's actually the category
 of person who probably
 will be most interested in
 donating if we actually
 make a record
 of that and follow up with them
 on it
 and I keep it right
 home care once a death happens
 that is close
 they can always come back
 but home care only they go for the
 commitment visit and after that
 there won't be much of contact
 so if you can have any register of that
 because one person I just met
 then he said
 their brother died
 two sisters killed
 my brother's birthday
 every once in a long time
 I got their record
 oh they said they want to donate
 yearly one
 so then maybe you make a call
 to follow up
 I keep the record
 I'm not sure whether social consultal
 they would have just told them
 but it would be great
 if we could record that
 yeah
 yeah
 if the record is there
 there's a lot of potential there
 wait what does beneficiary mean
 on the patient's money
 oh you mean their families
 the patients and the family will be served
 I mean the patient
 will pass away right
 you're talking about the family then
 even the patient when they are
 with us there are people who
 show interest in
 for an example there is an actor who would like
 to keep in touch for future things
 so let's say we are hosting some
 podcast
 and giving you some
 you can reach out to that person
 for marketing
 something like that
 and it holds a lot of potential
 because
 money is money
 and people are impressed
 they can donate 100 rupees to 100 rupees
 whatever they can
 because today I may be there
 and the record should be there
 no absolutely
 I think this is actually a really important one
 she said every year
 for my stepbrothers but I won't be there
 imagine if she could automatically get a reminder
 in whatsapp or email
 on the day of her brother's birthday
 saying hey like happy birthday from spar
 here's a reminder
 maybe I can also just call them
 how are you doing and also
 I can be in touch
 so if that automatic thing
 I don't care also
 but here I'm taking care of
 I can get some support
 just a simple thing like death animals
 death animals
 I don't know
 so I think maybe like
 what I'm hearing is there's
 maybe a disconnect between
 your patient side and the donor side
 like these two records are not
 being connected in any way
 actually I think that would be a really powerful thing
 if we do because the patients
 are more family than friends
 are the main people who will become
 supporters and yeah
 not only the patient first
 if I do get people who come and just talk to me
 just going about spush
 they would like to be associated with spush
 so those people are also
 potential donors
 and right now you don't have any way of capturing
 or making a record of death
 so I mean one thing anyway
 that I wanted to talk to you separately about
 is we need to implement like
 system for the donor side
 so that in industry
 is called like you know CRM
 customer relationship
 donor relationship
 so what I was thinking is like
 that might be one of the most
 impactful things we could do
 and then if we can make a
 link between that and the PN
 so you can get new
 like people
 so yeah that is what
 I'm going to talk to you about
 do you guys want to be involved in this
 discussion?
 yeah
 so I'm going to spend some more time with her
 just talking purely about the fundraising
 and donor side but this is actually
 a really interesting idea
 like because yeah
 you get a lot of people who come
 expressing interest maybe patients
 maybe inquiries and right now we have
 no way of capturing or making a record
 of death to follow up and
 they might forget and we might forget
 so I'm trying to make a note
 from my side I'm assuring I'm making
 because I can't expect the same from you
 but you're just one person right?
 and even for you if you make a note
 if you don't have any reminder system
 like you can't remember all the
 things
 today she might be there tomorrow she might
 go somewhere because with her
 all that thing will be disconnected
 we have to keep a system
 framework in place so that it won't
 so when she will come and register
 so that is there for it
 for discussion
 well thank you both so much
 for spending time with me
 I will also let my dad know
 and we'll get back to you guys
 once we figure out
 which one we can prioritize
 and then spend time with you
 I haven't done anything yet
 so I feel bad taking things
 if I actually
 after all this
 if you do something uninfluentialy
 then you can thank me
 so you come for your holiday?
 I'm here basically on paternity leave
 I had a baby two months ago
 and we're going to be here for another
 a couple of months so
 because I have some time now
 like my dad pulled me into this
 and said thank you
 so baby girl or baby boy?
 so baby boy and
 he is two months old
 so thank you so much
 thank you
