# Transcript summary

**Client:** Sparsh Hospice
**Date:** Discovery call - Donor management and fundraising
**Participants:** Donor management representative

## Client context

- Sparsh Hospice operates in India with separate US entity
- Non-profit organization providing palliative and hospice care
- Multiple revenue streams: individual donations, corporate CSR, private rooms, coffee shop rentals
- Annual donation mix: 55% CSR, individual donors, private rooms (78% of donations), corporate campaigns (5%)
- Uses DanaMojo (paid third-party donation platform) for online donations

## Current situation

**Existing tools and processes:**
- DanaMojo platform for online donations with automated receipt generation
- Excel sheets for donor tracking and reconciliation
- Manual annual reconciliation of large donors (5+ lakhs lifetime)
- "Tree of Kindness" wall for acknowledging major donors (HNIs - 5+ lakhs)
- Tally for accounting side records
- Manual outreach through Benevity (25-40 lakhs annually)
- Corporate engagement programs (Microsoft, Google, Teradata)

**Manual workflows or pain points:**
- Daily manual download of Excel from DanaMojo for bank reconciliation
- No system to track cumulative donations across years manually
- Risk of missing donors who reach 5+ lakh threshold across multiple donations
- Bank transfers without donor information require manual investigation
- Phone calls to unknown donors to collect PAN and address details
- Manual lead generation and follow-up through personal networks
- High friction donation process (must collect PAN, address, email to avoid tax)
- 3% anonymous donations (people who don't want to share details)
- Manual ROI calculation on lead follow-up (low due to manual effort)

**What's working well:**
- DanaMojo automation reduced anonymous donations from 8-9% to 3%
- Automated receipt generation for online donations
- Corporate workshops successful (Microsoft: 8.5 lakhs from 600 participants)
- Employee giving campaigns through corporate partnerships
- Benevity platform generating 25-40 lakhs annually

## Challenges

**Primary problems to solve:**
- No unified donor database across US and India entities
- Manual tracking of lifetime donation totals for HNI identification
- High donation friction due to anonymous donation tax implications (5% threshold)
- Manual lead capture and follow-up processes
- No automated nurturing of potential donors
- QR code donations not feasible (creates anonymous donors)
- Trade-off between donation ease (QR/UPI) and compliance (PAN collection)

**Impact of these problems:**
- Lost donations due to high friction in donation process
- Missed opportunities to identify and cultivate major donors
- High staff time cost for manual follow-up with low ROI
- Potential tax liability on anonymous donations above 5%
- No systematic approach to lead nurturing
- Donor interests expressed during care not captured systematically

**Urgency and priority:**
- High: Need CRM system for donor management
- Medium: Balance donation ease vs compliance requirements
- Medium: Improve lead capture and automated follow-up

## Goals

**Desired outcomes:**
- Implement CRM/donor relationship management system
- Unified donor database tracking lifetime contributions
- Automated lead capture and nurturing workflows
- Reduced donation friction while maintaining compliance
- Better integration between patient care and donor management

**Success metrics:**
- Increased donation conversion rates
- Improved identification of major donors (5+ lakhs)
- Higher capture rate of potential donor interests
- Reduced manual effort in donor management

**Timeline considerations:**
- Open to phased implementation
- Prioritize most impactful solutions first

## Constraints

**Budget considerations:**
- Currently pay for DanaMojo platform
- Willing to invest in solutions but need prioritization

**Technical constraints:**
- Excel-based manual tracking systems
- Separate US and India entities (completely separate operations)
- Tax regulations: anonymous donations above 5% of total are taxable
- PAN and address mandatory for donations above 2000 rupees
- India-specific regulations (80G receipts mandatory)

**Decision-making process:**
- Family-run organization with leadership involvement
- Willing to evaluate options and make decisions on priority

**Key stakeholders:**
- Donor management team
- Leadership (Dr. Subramanian)
- Corporate partnerships team
- Accounting team for reconciliation

## Opportunities

**Potential solutions discussed:**
- Lead capture system for interested prospects (not ready to donate immediately)
- Automated email/SMS campaigns for lead nurturing
- Integration with patient care system to capture donation interests
- QR code for initial interest capture (mailing list) vs immediate donation
- Automated reminders for important dates (birthdays, death anniversaries)
- Marketing outreach to people who want to be associated with Sparsh

**Low-hanging fruit:**
- Automated lead capture when people express interest
- Periodic email campaigns to nurture leads
- Connect patient care interests to donor management CRM
- Automated follow-up reminders for staff

**Larger transformation opportunities:**
- Full CRM implementation with donor segmentation
- Marketing automation for donor journeys
- Predictive analytics for donor conversion
- Integration between patient care (PIVAS) and donor management (CRM)
- Corporate partnership portal for employee engagement

## Next steps

**Follow-up items:**
- Share Excel sheet showing current donor data structure
- Review current donor information capture fields
- Explore CRM options for non-profit organizations
- Evaluate integration between PIVAS and potential CRM

**Information needed:**
- Detailed breakdown of current donation sources and percentages
- Annual total donation amounts for context
- Current fields captured in Excel sheets
- Integration requirements between patient care and donor management

**Decision timeline:**
- Will share Excel sheets for reference
- Need to determine priority between patient care improvements vs donor management system
- After reviewing options, will discuss internally and get back
