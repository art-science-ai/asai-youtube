# Project proposal

**Client:** Sparsh Hospice
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Prepared by:** [Your name]

## Executive summary

Through discovery conversations with the counseling and donor management teams, we identified two major opportunities to strengthen Sparsh's operations through technology. First, implementing a comprehensive donor management system with integrated lead capture will help systematically track donations, identify major donors, and nurture relationships. Second, creating a conversation-to-structured-data system will dramatically reduce manual documentation burden while improving data quality. This proposal recommends a phased approach, starting with quick wins that deliver immediate value while building toward long-term transformation.

## Problem statement

Sparsh provides exceptional hospice care but operates with manual, fragmented systems that limit effectiveness and create inefficiencies:

**Donor management challenges:**
- No unified donor database - tracking happens in Excel sheets
- Patient care (Pwens) completely disconnected from donor management
- Donation interests expressed by families during care are rarely captured systematically
- Manual annual reconciliation to identify major donors (5+ lakh lifetime total)
- High friction donation process due to India's tax regulations on anonymous donations

**Documentation inefficiencies:**
- Initial inquiries recorded in personal notebooks (not searchable, at risk if staff leave)
- Manual transcription of conversations into structured system notes (50+ minutes daily)
- Field staff struggle with real-time data entry due to network issues and typing burden
- 300 inquiries monthly with no digital capture or analytics capability

These issues result in missed donor opportunities, inefficient staff time utilization, and valuable data being lost or disconnected.

## Current situation

**Donor management ecosystem:**
- DanaMojo platform for online donations with automated receipt generation
- Excel-based donor tracking requiring manual reconciliation
- Annual manual process to identify major donors for "Tree of Kindness" acknowledgement
- Corporate partnerships managed through manual outreach and follow-up
- Donation mix: 55% CSR, significant individual donors, 5% corporate campaigns, private rooms
- 3% anonymous donations (tax risk if exceeds 5% threshold)

**Patient care and documentation:**
- Pwens (https://www.pwens.com) for registered patient records
- Personal notebooks for initial inquiries (paper-based, not digitized)
- Paper pre-assessment forms for potential cases
- WhatsApp groups for team coordination
- 10 inquiries daily (300 monthly) with 60-70% from word of mouth
- 40-minute consultations + 10-minute documentation per intake

**Key disconnect:**
Families frequently express donation interest during patient care, but there is no systematic way to capture this, notify the donor team, or follow up. The connection between gratitude for care received and future giving is lost.

## Proposed solution

We recommend a two-pronged approach addressing both donor management and documentation efficiency:

### Solution 1: Donor management system with integrated lead capture

**Business value:**
- Systematically capture donation interests expressed during patient care (currently lost due to manual processes)
- Build unified donor database to identify and cultivate major donors (HNIs) automatically
- Reduce manual effort on donor tracking, reconciliation, and follow-up
- Create sustainable donor pipeline through automated lead nurturing

**Impact:**
- Increased donation revenue through better identification and stewardship of major donors
- Improved donor retention through personalized, timely engagement
- Efficient corporate partnership and employee campaign management
- Data-driven decision making for fundraising strategy

### Solution 2: Conversation-to-structured-data system

**Business value:**
- Eliminate manual documentation burden (50+ minutes daily) across counseling and home care teams
- Ensure no inquiry or patient interaction is lost or poorly documented
- Enable real-time data accessibility for better care coordination
- Improve data quality for analytics and reporting

**Impact:**
- Significant time savings for clinical teams (refocused on patient care)
- Complete searchable record of all inquiries and patient interactions
- Faster intake process from initial contact to Pwens registration
- Reduced risk of data loss when staff turnover occurs

## Scope

### In scope

**Phase 1: Discovery (1 week)**
- Detailed workflow analysis with counseling, home care, and donor teams
- Document all data fields and integration points
- Evaluate technology options for both solutions
- Design architecture and implementation approach

**Phase 2: Implementation (3-4 weeks, parallel workstreams)**
- Workstream A: Donor management system
  - CRM or database implementation for unified donor tracking
  - Pwens integration for donor interest capture and notifications
  - Lead capture from web forms and patient care interactions
  - Basic reporting and donor lifetime value tracking
- Workstream B: Conversation-to-structured-data system
  - Transcription and data extraction tool setup
  - Integration with Pwens for automated form population
  - Mobile-friendly interface for field teams
  - Offline capability for areas with poor network

**Phase 3: Delivery and handover (1 week)**
- User acceptance testing with both teams
- Documentation and training materials
- Team training sessions
- Go-live support and troubleshooting
- Knowledge transfer for ongoing maintenance

### Out of scope

- Pwens core system modifications (we can extend/integrate but not rebuild)
- Clinical decision support tools (beyond basic priority indicators)
- Full marketing automation platform (beyond donor nurture campaigns)
- Visit scheduling optimization algorithms
- Compliance/legal review of donor data handling (may need separate expertise)
- 24/7 support or ongoing maintenance (handoff after implementation)

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Discovery (1 week) - Requirements analysis, workflow documentation, technology evaluation, architecture design
- Phase 2: Implementation (3-4 weeks) - Two parallel workstreams:
  - Workstream A: Donor management system implementation and Pwens integration
  - Workstream B: Conversation-to-structured-data system development
- Phase 3: Delivery and handover (1 week) - Testing, documentation, team training, change management support

**Estimated completion:** 4-6 weeks from kickoff

Timeline is flexible based on your priorities and team availability.

## Investment

This is a **pro bono scoped engagement**.

**What we provide:**
- Requirements analysis and solution design
- Technology evaluation and recommendations
- Implementation of agreed-upon solutions
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Change management support during handover

**What Sparsh provides:**
- Access to team members for discovery interviews and feedback
- Decision-making authority for approvals
- Time from stakeholders for testing and training
- Honest feedback to guide implementation

## Next steps

1. Review this proposal with your team and leadership
2. Schedule Q&A to discuss questions and refinements
3. Approve scope and kickoff Phase 1 (discovery)
4. Execute implementation phases with regular check-ins
5. Delivery, training, and handoff
