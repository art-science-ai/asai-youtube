# Client engagement process

## Overview

For an AI consulting business, you want to maintain a "lean but professional" paper trail. Having too many documents feels like red tape; having too few makes you look like a hobbyist.

This guide outlines the end-to-end client engagement lifecycle, from marketing through handoff.
