## Notes
### Quick capture notes
- Title: obsidian css for wide tables
- Details: add a small CSS snippet that exempts tables from Obsidian’s “Readable line length” max-width and makes wide tables horizontally scrollable. That keeps your nice readable width for normal text but lets tables span wider / scroll so many columns remain usable.
