## Goals
- [ ]  **Collect docs:** CapOne Trip #, **Lufthansa PNR**, boarding denial note (or your written statement), **seat + baggage receipts**.
- [ ]  **CapOne Travel → ticket taxes/fees:** In **My Trips**, request **refund of unused government taxes/airport charges** for the unused LH ticket. If self-service won’t submit, **call support** and ask them to file a **tax/fees-only refund** with Lufthansa. Record the **case ID**.
- [ ]  **Lufthansa → ancillaries (seat & extra bag):** Use LH Customer Relations/Refund form. Select ancillary refund, attach receipts, request a **goodwill refund** (services unused). Record the **case ID**.
- [ ]  **File + follow-ups:** Save confirmations, receipts, and case IDs in one folder; set a calendar reminder to check status.
- [ ]  **Escalation plan (if needed):**
    - [ ] CapOne stalling → ask them to **escalate to Lufthansa** for taxes/fees on a non-ref ticket.
    - [ ] Lufthansa denies ancillaries → send one polite **goodwill re-request** with receipts; if declined again, close the loop.

## Notes

### Context
- I booked a Lufthansa flight SFO - HYD Economy Basic booked via Capital One travel portal. Additionally I paid for extra baggage and seat selection directly on the Lufthansa website. 
- On the departure date Oct 11 I went to the airport and was turned away at check-in desk due to lack of Germany transit visa. I then rebooked on an Air India flight. 
- Now I want to request a refund for the Lufthansa flight and the additional baggage + seat selection.
