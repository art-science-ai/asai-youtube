## Abstract

Since the launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has developed rapidly and entered higher education institutions (HEIs). This article helps HEIs develop strategic approaches to AI, investigating how AI influences higher education in terms of mission, organization, and context. The central question asks whether AI should be regarded as a strategic objective or merely as a tool to realize existing strategy.

The study addresses four main research questions:
1. How does AI influence HEIs in their mission, organization, and context?
2. Should AI be regarded as a strategic objective or just a tool?
3. How can AI adoption be managed effectively and responsibly?
4. What influence does AI have on leadership and culture?

**Methodology:** Meta-analysis of international surveys and two case studies with blind peer review.

**Key Finding:** Although AI use in HEIs is varied, effective and responsible adoption of AI is a new strategic objective essential for realizing higher education's three-fold mission (learning, research, societal service).

## 1. Introduction

### The Transformative Landscape

Higher education has confronted accelerating global changes since 2000. The World Economic Forum's concept of the "4th Industrial Revolution" describes a new era of cyber-physical systems embedded in societies and human bodies, creating technology-driven transformation.

### AI's Historical Significance

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and others have declared that **generative AI "will be the most transformative technology since electricity."** This transformative power extends beyond technology into international relations, economics, and military applications.

### Recent AI Breakthroughs (2024-2025)

- **Nobel Prize Recognition**: John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the 2024 Physics Nobel Prize for foundational AI work
- **Chemistry Nobel**: Half awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, linked to AI through Google DeepMind
- **MIT Technology Review 2025 Breakthroughs**:
  - AI agents
  - Small language models
  - Generative virtual playgrounds
  - LLMs that reason
  - AI in science
  - AI/national security integration
  - New competition to Nvidia in chip production

### Central Questions for HEIs

This article examines whether AI represents:
- A continuation of digitalization?
- A fundamental transformation requiring new leadership and strategy?

## 2. Research Methodology

### Approach
- **Meta-analysis** of international surveys and research literature
- **Global scope** from international institutions, organizations, and consultancies
- **Quality criteria**: Topical usefulness, international scope, statistical relevance, research quality
- **Stakeholder validation**: Minimum 2 international surveys per stakeholder group
- **Case studies**: In-depth interviews at Ghent University and HOWEST (West-Flanders)

### Four Core Research Questions

1. How does AI and AI tools influence HE(Is) in mission, organization, and context?
2. Should AI and applications be regarded as a strategic objective or a tool for realizing existing strategy?
3. How can AI adoption and integration be managed effectively and responsibly?
4. What influence does AI have on leadership and culture?

### Governance Framework
The article employs a stakeholders' model approach, recognizing that successful strategy building and performance require input from multiple constituencies.

## 3. Transformative Times and Challenges

### Five Global Interconnected Challenges (Bollaert Framework)

1. **Global economy** - Financial crises and fiscal constraints
2. **Geopolitical dimension** - Tensions, conflicts, and security concerns
3. **Climate change** - Environmental sustainability imperatives
4. **Digitalization, IT, and AI** - Technology acceleration and integration
5. **Physical and mental health** - Student and staff wellbeing

### OECD Trends Shaping Education (2025)

**Global Conflict & Cooperation**: Security and defense budgets expanding at expense of education

**Work & Progress**: Global labor market transformation due to AI and sustainability requirements

**Voices & Storytelling**: Questions about whose voices are heard in digital, globalized contexts; rise of populism and need for critical thinking

**Bodies & Minds**: Connections between physical/mental health, environment, and societal changes

### Cross-Cutting Themes
- Technology advancements, especially AI
- Environmental sustainability

## 4. University Leadership in Transformative Times

### Digital Academic Leadership (DAL)

A relatively understudied but crucial concept defining effective leadership through ICT use to achieve strategic aims.

**DAL Requirements:**
- Inspire digital change
- Motivate stakeholders in digital transformation
- Go beyond technology to strategic alignment

**Nine Contemporary DAL Descriptions** with 16 sub-divisions range from "lead and manage digital/technological knowledge" to "strategic use of digital assets for organizational goals."

### Leadership Characteristics for the 21st Century

Effective HEI leaders must embody:
- Visionary thinking
- Transformational approach
- Service orientation
- Authentic listening and care
- Consistency and engagement
- Culture awareness
- Value-driven decisions
- Ethical "correctness"
- Flexibility and resilience
- Transparency and honesty
- Team collaboration
- Professional management excellence

**Critical Insight:** This list reveals leadership cannot be possessed by one individual—modern leadership must be a **professional team** sharing vision, mission, beliefs, and values.

## 5. AI in a Nutshell: History and Development

### Timeline of AI Evolution

The article traces AI development from its conceptual foundations through contemporary applications, demonstrating how each era built upon previous advances.

### Key Historical Moments

- **Symbolic AI era** - Rule-based approaches
- **Machine Learning emergence** - Statistical pattern recognition
- **Deep Learning revolution** - Neural networks and big data
- **Generative era** - Transformer models and foundation models
- **Autonomous agents** - Self-directing AI systems

## 6. Current and Future Attitudes Toward AI

### Stakeholder Perspectives

The research analyzes attitudes and implementation levels among:
- Faculty and researchers
- Students
- Administrative staff
- External stakeholders (employers, policymakers)

### Implementation Levels

Range from minimal exploration to strategic integration across institutional operations.

## Key Strategic Implications

### AI as Strategic Objective

Rather than treating AI as merely a tool:
- **Strategic integration** requires deliberate planning and resource allocation
- **Responsible adoption** demands clear policy frameworks and guidelines
- **Unique human competencies** (critical thinking, creativity) must be enhanced, not replaced

### Framework for Responsible AI Integration

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Transparency** - Clear communication about AI use and limitations
2. **Responsibility** - Accountability for AI-driven decisions
3. **Critical Thinking** - Human judgment remains central to decision-making

### Visionary Leadership Requirements

HEIs need leadership that:
- Establishes clear policy frameworks and guidelines
- Ensures transparency in AI use
- Maintains focus on developing unique human competencies
- Balances efficiency gains with educational mission
- Addresses ethical concerns proactively

## Conclusion

**Main Finding:** Effective and responsible adoption and integration of AI represents a **new strategic objective** for HEIs rather than merely a tools implementation.

This shift requires:
- **Visionary leadership** capable of navigating transformation
- **Clear policy frameworks** guiding responsible AI use
- **Strategic alignment** with HEI's three-fold mission
- **Culture of critical thinking** where AI enhances rather than replaces human judgment
- **Organizational readiness** through professional teams with shared vision

The future of higher education depends on proactively addressing these challenges rather than reacting to AI-driven disruption.
