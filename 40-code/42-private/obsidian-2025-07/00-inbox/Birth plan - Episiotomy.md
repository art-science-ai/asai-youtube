## Summary
- All major medical guidelines recommend **restrictive/selective episiotomy** only when truly indicated, whereas OB recommends **routine episiotomy**. 
- Need to decide if we should trust OB's recommendation vs. insist on following the major medical guidelines

## What the medical guidelines recommend
- **Do not consent to routine episiotomy.** All major guidelines recommend **restrictive/selective use only**. [WHO 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513802/table/executivesummary.tu1/), [ACOG 2018 PB198](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/09/prevention-and-management-of-obstetric-lacerations-at-vaginal-delivery), [RCOG/NICE](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf), [FOGSI 2024 GCPR](https://www.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Binder_Prevention-and-Management-of-Perineal-Tear.pdf).
- If an episiotomy is **truly indicated**, ask for a **mediolateral cut ~60° from the midline** at crowning (avoid midline). [RCOG OASI Care Bundle](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf), [NICE MTG47](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/mtg47/chapter/1-Recommendations), [StatPearls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559068/).
- **Prevention bundle**: warm perineal compresses + manual support at crowning + antenatal perineal massage from ~35 weeks (1–2×/week). [Cochrane 2017](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006672.pub3/full), [Cochrane 2022](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD005123_antenatal-perineal-massage-reducing-perineal-trauma), [RACGP](https://www.racgp.org.au/clinical-resources/clinical-guidelines/handi/conditions/musculoskeletal/antenatal-perineal-massage-reduce-perineal-injury).

## What the Ob-Gyn recommends
- **Indication**: OB recommends routine episiotomy regardless of indication; the recommendation seems to based on her personal experience with past patients and prevailing norms at the hospital
- **Technique**: not specified: mediolateral ~60° vs. midline
- Notes from mom
	- Usually only to protect from anal canal tears

## Options
Need to decide one of the following options and discuss with OB:

1. Go with the OB's recommendation for routine episiotomy.
	1. Pros: OB is more comfortable with this approach
	2. Cons: It is contrary to major medical guidelines
2. Insist on not performing episiotomy unless truly indicated according to major medical guidelines
	1. Pros: In line with major medical guidelines 
	2. Cons: Contrary to what OB is comfortable with 
3. Find some middle ground solution: agree on the criteria under which episiotomy is indicated (e.g. if forceps/ventouse becomes necessary) and the technique to be used (e.g. mediolateral at ~60 vs. midline)

### What the guidelines say
- **WHO (2018)** — “Routine or liberal use of episiotomy is **not recommended** for spontaneous vaginal birth.” [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513802/table/executivesummary.tu1/).
- **ACOG PB 198 (2018)** — Routine episiotomy **offers no maternal benefit** vs restrictive use; may increase anal incontinence; use **restrictively**. [link](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/09/prevention-and-management-of-obstetric-lacerations-at-vaginal-delivery).
- **RCOG/NICE (UK)** — Avoid routine episiotomy; **if indicated**, perform **mediolateral at ~60°** at crowning; consider with **forceps/ventouse** to reduce OASI risk. [RCOG OASI](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf), [NICE MTG47](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/mtg47/chapter/1-Recommendations).
- **FOGSI (India, 2024)** — **Discourages routine episiotomy**; recommends **selective/judicious use** and prevention techniques. [link](https://www.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Binder_Prevention-and-Management-of-Perineal-Tear.pdf).

### What the research shows (why “restrictive”)
- **Cochrane review (2017, 11 RCTs; ~6,000 women):** Selective episiotomy led to **fewer severe perineal/vaginal traumas** vs routine use; **no neonatal benefit** to routine use. [clinical summary](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD000081_selective-versus-routine-use-episiotomy-vaginal-birth), [full text](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5449575/).
- **Technique matters:** **Midline** episiotomy increases OASI; **mediolateral ~60°** is protective, especially with instruments. [StatPearls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559068/), [RCOG OASI](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf), [NICE MTG47](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/mtg47/chapter/1-Recommendations).
- **Adjuncts that help:** Warm compresses and hands-on support reduce third-/fourth‑degree tears; antenatal perineal massage reduces need for episiotomy and persistent pain. [Cochrane 2017](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006672.pub3/full), [Cochrane 2022](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD005123_antenatal-perineal-massage-reducing-perineal-trauma).

### When an episiotomy can be appropriate (selective use)
Consider only with **clear clinical indications**, e.g.:
- **Instrument‑assisted birth** (forceps/ventouse), particularly in first births. [RCOG OASI](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf).
- **Expedited birth** needed (e.g., fetal heart concerns) where a cut is expected to **materially shorten** delivery. [ACOG PB198](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/09/prevention-and-management-of-obstetric-lacerations-at-vaginal-delivery).
- **Imminent severe tear** judged clinically (ischaemic, non‑stretching perineum). [RCOG OASI](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf).

**If performed:** request **mediolateral ~60°** at crowning (right‑sided cut), adequate local anaesthesia, and careful layered repair. [RCOG OASI](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf), [NICE MTG47](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/mtg47/chapter/1-Recommendations).

### India‑specific context
- **FOGSI (2024) GCPR** aligns with WHO/ACOG/UK: **no routine episiotomy**; emphasize prevention and proper technique. [link](https://www.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Binder_Prevention-and-Management-of-Perineal-Tear.pdf).
- **Angle accuracy matters:** Survey of Indian obstetricians highlights difficulty achieving true **~60°** without guides/training—supporting a *do‑it‑well‑when‑indicated* approach. [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13224-023-01871-8). Tools like **Episcissors‑60** can help standardize angle where available. [NICE MTG47](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/mtg47/chapter/1-Recommendations).

### Discussion plan with your OB (copy/paste)
- **Policy:** “We **do not consent to routine episiotomy**; please use it **only if clearly indicated**, consistent with WHO/FOGSI/ACOG/RCOG.” ([WHO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513802/table/executivesummary.tu1/), [FOGSI](https://www.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Binder_Prevention-and-Management-of-Perineal-Tear.pdf)).
- **Numbers:** “What are your unit’s **episiotomy rate** (for spontaneous births) and **OASI rate**?” (quality metrics)
- **Technique:** “If needed, do you perform **mediolateral ~60°** (not midline)? Do you use angle guides or training?” ([RCOG OASI](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/rntlozz3/oasi-care-bundle-guide-final-_-050118.pdf), [NICE MTG47](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/mtg47/chapter/1-Recommendations)).
- **Prevention bundle:** “Can we plan for **warm compresses + hands‑on perineal support** at crowning, and I’ll start **perineal massage from 35 weeks (1–2×/wk)**?” ([Cochrane 2017](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006672.pub3/full), [Cochrane 2022/RACGP](https://www.racgp.org.au/clinical-resources/clinical-guidelines/handi/conditions/musculoskeletal/antenatal-perineal-massage-reduce-perineal-injury)).

**Rapid consent sentence for labour:**
> *“We don’t consent to a routine episiotomy. If you believe one is **clinically necessary**, please say: ‘We recommend an episiotomy now because ___. We’ll perform a **mediolateral ~60°** cut.’ We’ll consent if we agree.”*
