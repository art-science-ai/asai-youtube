## TLDR
- If minimizing pain and getting reliable output matters most, **Spectra S1 Plus** is the best single purchase: hospital-grade tunability + closed system + wide flange size availability make it easiest to dial-in comfort. 
- **Runner-up: Philips Avent SCF323** — gentler out-of-the-box mouthpiece (adaptive silicone cushion) and simpler presets make it the lowest-fuss option for many mothers. 
- **Deal-breakers:** incorrect flange size, lack of closed-system (backflow protection), and poor access to spare flanges/valves — any of these greatly increase risk of pain, leaks, or hygiene problems.

## Recommendation

### Top choice: Spectra S1 Plus
- **Why:** Best combination of fine-grained motor control (independent stimulation vs expression control and cycle speed), quiet operation with battery, and an established ecosystem of interchangeable flange/shield sizes. Those three together are the fastest path to pain‑free pumping for sensitive nipples and frequent pumping schedules.
- **How it satisfies key factors:** Pain & comfort — superior tunability + multiple flange sizes; Hygiene & maintenance — closed-system design reduces backflow risk; Convenience — rechargeable battery + quiet motor for night sessions.
- **Caveats:** Price is higher than budget electrics; will need to buy the right flange sizes (usually 1–2 extras) to guarantee comfort.

### Runner-up: Philips Avent SCF323 (Essential)
- **Why:** Adaptive silicone cushion (petal design) minimizes immediate trial-and-error for many users and the simple 4+4 stimulation/expression presets are easy to use.
- **When it might be better:** If you want a lower-stress, lower-fuss experience out of the box (and pump only occasionally), Philips is often the gentler first purchase.
- **Missing vs Spectra:** Less granular control over cycle speed and vacuum; fewer official discrete flange sizes in the default kit (but cushions and shields are available separately).

### When to reconsider
- **If your wife measures a very small or very large nipple diameter** (outside typical ranges), choose a pump with **explicit, easy-to-buy flange sizes** (Spectra or Medela) rather than a one-size-adaptive design. 
- **If mobility and hands-free pumping is the top priority**, choose a wearable (Momcozy, Promom) as a convenience-first purchase — but plan to keep a desktop pump for supply-building or exclusive pumping days.
- **Timing considerations:** Amazon.in listings and local stock fluctuate; if a specific model is out of stock, prioritize availability of **two flange sizes** and extra valves over exact brand.

## Consideration Factors

### 1) Pain & comfort (Motor tunability + flange fit)
- **Why it matters:** Pain is primarily caused by excessive vacuum, improper cycle speed, or a flange that pinches/creates friction. A pump with fine control and correct flange sizing reduces pain and often improves milk output.
- **Good performance:** Independent control of cycle speed and vacuum; multiple flange sizes or a genuinely adaptive silicone cushion; quiet motor to allow gentle ramp-up.
- **Trade-offs:** Wearables often trade tunability and flange choices for mobility; budget pumps may have fewer granular controls.

### 2) Hygiene & maintenance (Closed system & spare parts)
- **Why it matters:** Closed systems prevent milk/backflow from reaching tubing and motors, reducing contamination risk and making cleaning/maintenance easier. Ready access to replacement valves and duckbills prevents loss of suction over time.
- **Good performance:** Explicit closed-system design; easy-to-buy valves/flanges in local market.
- **Trade-offs:** Closed systems are generally more desirable but check the model docs — many budget wearables use marketing language without detailed specs.

### 3) Convenience & portability (Wearable vs Desktop, noise, battery)
- **Why it matters:** Mobility decides whether your wife can pump during light chores or must sit still; noise level affects night pumping and ease of use around family.
- **Good performance:** Wearables for mobility; quiet desktop pumps with rechargeable batteries for night-time convenience.
- **Trade-offs:** Wearables trade off some suction power and flange options for hands-free convenience.
