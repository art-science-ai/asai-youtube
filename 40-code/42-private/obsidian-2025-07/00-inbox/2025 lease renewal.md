Hi Aylet and 55 W team, thank you for your help on the month‑to‑month (MTM) billing issue and for applying the $1,799.87 credit. I’ve paid the September rent at the MTM rate, but I’m still interested in signing a new 12‑month lease that is below the MTM rate, and would appreciate any help your team can provide in getting to a new offer. Here is some further context for your consideration:

1) On June 28, 2025, I proposed $5,910/mo ($5,800 rent + $110 parking) based on market research.

1a) Zillow estimate for 55 W 5th Ave, Apt 17B: approx. $5,500/mo https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/55-W-5th-Ave-APT-17B-San-Mateo-CA-94402/2089500169_zpid/
   
1b) Rentometer (3-bed comps near 55 W 5th Ave): 75th percentile approx. $5,738 https://www.rentometer.com/analysis/3-bed/55-w-5th-ave-san-mateo-ca/5VN4Ambyj6A#
   
2) In late July/early August, I was repeatedly quoted an incorrect MTM rate of $8,000+ on multiple phone calls, emails, billing statements, and a "notice to pay rent or quit" notice on my door (despite on-time payment of the correct amount). I appreciate your help in reversing the excess MTM charges, but given these issues, I’m seeking a reasonable lease rate below MTM.

Hi Aylet and 55 W team,

Thanks for your help. I just paid the September rent today at the MTM rate, but I'm still interested in signing a lease, and would appreciate any help you can provide. Some factors to consider:

--

1) In my previous email communication with the renewals team dated Jun 28, 2025, I had proposed a counter-offer of $5800 rent + $110 parking = $5910. This seemed like a fair offer based on the following market research: 

1a) The Zillow rent estimate for 55 W 5th Av Apt 17B is ~ $5,500/mo: https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/55-W-5th-Ave-APT-17B-San-Mateo-CA-94402/2089500169_zpid/

1b) Data from Rentometer [B] shows that the 75th percentile rent for comparable apartments is $5,738: https://www.rentometer.com/analysis/3-bed/55-w-5th-ave-san-mateo-ca/5VN4Ambyj6A#

2) I believe I was treated quite unfairly in the prior lease renewal discussions.

2a) When trying to negotiate a lease rate that is lower than the MTM rate, we were told multiple times verbally and in writing (via email and via our rent statement) that our MTM rate is $8000/mo+, which we repeatedly pointed out is incorrect and illegal. 

2b) We were diligently communicating with your team to resolve this issue. Moreover, I manually calculated the correct amount and paid it by the due date of Aug 5th. Yet I still received a public notice on my door stating that I was delinquent on rent payments.  

2c) It took over two weeks with several follow-up communications to finally get the incorrect rent charges waived from my statement, and never received even a courtesy apology for the stress and inconvenience that we were put through during this ordeal.

--

3) The lease offer I have repeatedly recieved is equal to the MTM rate, which is highly unusual. A lease offer that is below the MTM rate in consideration of the situation would be desirable.
