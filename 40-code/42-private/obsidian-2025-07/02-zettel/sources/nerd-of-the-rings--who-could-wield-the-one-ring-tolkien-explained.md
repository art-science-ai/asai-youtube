# AI notes

## TLDR
- The common movie misconception that only Sauron could wield the One Ring is false according to Tolkien's letters and books.
- Powerful beings like Gandalf, Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond could have wielded and even mastered the Ring, but would have become new Dark Lords.
- Even some mortals, like Aragorn and potentially Frodo, could have wielded the Ring with some success, though not mastered it.
- The Ring's power corrupts, and its destruction was the only true solution to defeat Sauron and prevent another Dark Lord.

## Key ideas
- The One Ring's wieldability extends beyond Sauron to powerful individuals, both Maiar and Elves.
- Wielding the Ring inevitably leads to corruption and the rise of a new Dark Lord, even for those with good intentions.
- Tolkien's writings clarify that even mortals like Aragorn could wield the Ring, though mastering it was beyond them.
- Frodo, as Ringbearer, developed a unique connection to the Ring, granting him some influence over Ringwraiths, but not mastery.
- The destruction of the Ring was the only way to truly defeat Sauron and prevent its corrupting influence from creating another evil.

## Detailed Summary
- **Introduction to the Misconception:** The video addresses the common belief, often fueled by movie lines, that only Sauron could wield the One Ring. It clarifies that this is a misconception, citing Tolkien's own letters.
- **Elrond's Explanation:** The video references Elrond's explanation in the books, stating that while the Ring is evil and belongs to Sauron, those with great power of their own *could* wield it. However, the desire for power would corrupt them, leading to a new Dark Lord.
- **Gandalf's Potential:** Tolkien's Letter 246 is cited, where he discusses Gandalf claiming the Ring. Gandalf, as a Ring Lord, would have been "far worse than Sauron," and while Sauron would be defeated, the Ring's evil would endure.
- **Other Powerful Beings:** The video confirms that powerful beings like Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond also had the potential to wield and master the Ring, but with the same corrupting outcome.
- **Mortal Wielders - Aragorn:** The video highlights that even some mortals, specifically Aragorn, could have wielded the Ring. Gandalf's words after the Battle of Pelennor Fields imply Aragorn's strength and his ability to wield it, especially after revealing himself to Sauron via the Palantír. However, Aragorn could not *master* it, a capability reserved for higher-level beings.
- **Mortal Wielders - Frodo:** It's implied that Frodo, despite his small stature, could have grown capable of wielding the Ring with some success. Galadriel notes his increased keenness of sight due to bearing the Ring. Tolkien's letters suggest Frodo could have had some effect on the Ringwraiths at Mount Doom, commanding them to a minor degree, but not mastering them or the Ring itself.
- **Conclusion:** The video reiterates that the Ring's inherent evil and corrupting influence meant that its destruction was the only viable path to true victory, as any wielder, no matter how powerful or well-intentioned, would ultimately succumb to its power and become a new Dark Lord.

### Key quotes
- "You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master." (Movie Aragorn - presented as a misconception)
- "Alas, no, said Elrond. We cannot use the ruling ring. That we now know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for them, it holds an even deadlier apparel. The very desire of it corrupts the heart." (Book Elrond)
- "If Gandalf proved the victor, the result would have been for Sauron the same as the destruction of the ring... But the ring and all its works would have endured. It would have been the master in the end. He then goes on to say that Gandalf as ring lord would have been far worse than Sauron." (Tolkien's Letter 246)
- "For if we have found this thing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. That too he knows. For do I not guess rightly, Aragorn, that you have shown yourself to him in the stone of Allank." (Book Gandalf to Aragorn)
- "Only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try. It would destroy you." (Galadriel to Frodo)
- "Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor. Before you could use that power, you would need to become far stronger and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet even so, as ringbearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight has grown keener." (Galadriel to Frodo)

### Source Description

The one ring answers to Sauron alone...or does it?  It's one of the most common misconceptions I see in my comments section - the idea that anyone but Sauron using the ring was out of the question.  However, as Tolkien himself says in his letters - it was possible for others to use, and even master the One Ring!

You cannot wield it. None of us can.
The one ring answers to Sauron alone. It
has no other master. Of all the lines in
the Lord of the Rings films, this is the
one that's led to the most comments
attempting to correct me on my channel.
My theory videos are among some of my
most popular. And without fail, anytime
we go down the rabbit hole of various
characters claiming the one ring, I get
comments quoting this line from Aragorn
in the films. The problem is film
Aragorn is wrong. To be clear, this
isn't something I think the films got
wrong necessarily. Indeed, Aragorn here
is kind of summarizing what another
character says in the very same book
scene. and Gandalf in Bagend explains
what would happen should he take the
ring. While I think these lines in the
film are quite effective in conveying
what needs to be conveyed, it seems
Aragorn's in particular have given some
folks a false impression of the
wieldability of the ring. And as we look
to the books, we find that the list of
people who could have wielded it may be
surprising. As I mentioned, Aragorn's
line is cutting to the heart of what
Eland conveys in the book. Alas, no,
said Eland. We cannot use the ruling
ring. That we now know too well. It
belongs to Sauron and was made by him
alone and is altogether evil. Its
strength, Boromir, is too great for
anyone to wield at will, save only those
who have already a great power of their
own. But for them, it holds an even
deadlier apparel. The very desire of it
corrupts the heart. Consider Sauruman.
If any of the wise should with this ring
overthrow the Lord of Mordor using his
own arts, he would then set himself on
Sauron's throne. And yet another dark
lord would appear. And that is another
reason why the ring should be destroyed.
As long as it is in the world, it will
be a danger even to the wise. For
nothing is evil in the beginning. Even
Sauron was not so. I fear to take the
ring to hide it. I will not take the
ring to wield it. As we see, this
section kind of cuts to the chase of the
whole problem with the one ring. The
object is altogether evil. Sure, some
could wield it, but they themselves
would just become another dark lord.
Tolken himself commented on this
possibility in letter 246,
specifically talking about Gandalf
claiming the one ring. If Gandalf proved
the victor, the result would have been
for Sauron the same as the destruction
of the ring. For him, it would have been
destroyed, taken from him forever. But
the ring and all its works would have
endured. It would have been the master
in the end. He then goes on to say that
Gandalf as ring lord would have been far
worse than Sauron. So not only would the
one ring corrupt Gandalf into becoming a
new dark lord. But for Sauron, this
outcome would have been the same as when
the ring is destroyed in the actual
story. Sauron would be forever defeated.
So, we know from Tolken's words that a
mighty being like Gandalf or Saurroman
and perhaps even Galadriel or Eland
could have wielded and even mastered the
one ring. While we've shown movie
Aragorn is mistaken in saying none could
wield it, we see in the books that he
may be mistaken on a somewhat comical
level, for it's even hinted that some
mortals could have wielded the ring with
some success, including Aragorn himself.
As early as Rivendell, we find Gandalf
saying there were multiple beings in
Middle Earth perhaps capable of
overthrowing Sauron with his ring.
Indeed, he is in great fear, not knowing
what mighty one may suddenly appear,
wielding the ring and assailing him with
war, seeking to cast him down and take
his place. That we should seek to cast
him down and have no one in his place is
not a thought that occurs to his mind.
That we should try to destroy the ring
itself has not yet entered into his
darkest dream. Now the most likely
characters being referred to here are
those among the most powerful like
Gandalf, Galadriel, Eland, and even
Sauruman. But in a later chapter, we
find Gandalf the White give a direct
indication toward Aragorn. This comes
after the victory at Pelanor Fields when
the great leaders of Gondor and Rohan
are debating what should be their next
move. Now Sauron knows all this and he
knows that this precious thing which he
lost has been found again, but he does
not yet know where it is. Or so we hope.
And therefore he is now in great doubt.
For if we have found this thing, there
are some among us with strength enough
to wield it. That too he knows. For do I
not guess rightly, Aragorn, that you
have shown yourself to him in the stone
of Allank. While we know for certain, as
Sauron does, that Gandalf would be a
threat should he claim the ring, notice
that Gandalf implies there are multiple
among them capable of doing so. A group
consisting of himself, the sons of
Eland, and a bunch of mortal men. He
then immediately turns to Aragorn,
confirming that he revealed himself to
the dark lord. Second to Gandalf,
Aragorn is no doubt the most likely
person to be capable of wielding the
ring. He has already shown his
incredible strength by wrestling control
of the Palunteer of Orthank as he
revealed himself to Sauron. Now, we must
point out in this video an incredibly
important distinction. Though Aragorn
would be capable of wielding the ring,
this does not mean he could master it.
That potential according to Tolken
himself seems to stop at higher level
beings like mayar or very powerful
elves. Yet as we further seek to put to
rest the idea that none but Sauron could
wield it, we don't stop merely at
Aragorn. For it is even implied that
Frodo, the tiny halfling could have
grown capable of doing so with some
measure of success. In Laurian,
Galadriel tells the ring bearer, "Only
thrice have you set the ring upon your
finger since you knew what you
possessed. Do not try. It would destroy
you." Did not Gandalf tell you that the
rings give power according to the
measure of each possessor. Before you
could use that power, you would need to
become far stronger and to train your
will to the domination of others. Yet
even so, as ringbearer and as one that
has borne it on finger and seen that
which is hidden, your sight has grown
keener. Galadriel points out that Frodo
has already grown keener in sight from
the ring. Not only that he had noticed
Galadriel's own hidden ring of power,
but she goes on to say that he has
perceived her thought more clearly than
many that are accounted wise. And in one
of Tolken's letters, he indicates that
Froto may have had some effect upon the
ring wraiths, should he have sought to
command them at Mount Doom. But the
situation was now different to that
under Weathertop, where Froto acted
merely in fear and wished only to use in
vain the ring's subsidiary power of
conferring invisibility.
He had grown since then. Would they have
been immune from its power if he claimed
it as an instrument of command and
domination?
Not wholly. I do not think they could
have attacked him with violence, nor
laid hold upon him or taken him captive.
They would have obeyed or fained to obey
any minor commands of his that did not
interfere with their errand laid upon
them by Sauron who still through their
nine rings which he held had primary
control of their wills. While Froto
could have grown to have some measure of
success wielding the ring, it's pretty
clear he also would never have been able
to be its master. As for Aragorn
himself, that we will save for another
video. For one so great among men, as we
have shown, could indeed wield the ring,
but could never master it, resulting in
an outcome full of treachery and
darkness. In the meantime, I'll leave
you with the question, what do you think
would happen if Aragorn were to take the
ring for his own? Let me know in the
comments.
