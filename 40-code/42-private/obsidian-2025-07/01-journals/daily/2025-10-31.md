Hi everyone, Rukma's delivery is scheduled for Monday November 3. If all goes according to plan, we will stay at the hospital for 2-3 nights post-delivery and return home by Thursday.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any info over the next few days and weeks - especially to plan your travel etc. Rukma will be focusing on delivery + recovery (so please don't expect her to answer the phone or reply to any messages), but I will be happy to help with anything!

Looking forward for all of you to meet your new grandson / nephew! 😊
