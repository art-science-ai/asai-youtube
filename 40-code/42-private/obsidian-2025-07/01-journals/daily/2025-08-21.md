	- Context
		- Unzip the archive to find the directories
		- 00-filing directory contains diwakar-prep-v1.pdf (completed tax preparation form from my accountant) and excel-1040.xlsx (popular online tax preparation spreadsheet template)
		- 01-inputs directories contain all the input forms that I provided to my accountant to prepare this filing.
	- Instructions
		- The goal is to verify the accuracy of diwakar-prep-v1.pdf by populating excel-1040.xlsx and comparing the results.  
		- First use the information from diwakar-prep-v1.pdf to populate excel-1040.xlsx
		- Then double check all the inputs to excel-1040.xlsx by looking at the files in 01-input. For each data entered in excel-1040.xlsx, add a note referencing the data source. Call out if there is any discrepancy between the data sources and what Diwakar has prepared.
		- At the end, return the populated and annotated excel-1040.xlsx together with a brief summary of key findings and areas I might want to look more closely into.
