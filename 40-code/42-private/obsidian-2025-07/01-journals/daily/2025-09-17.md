- Why build term?
	- There are several capable terminal based AI coding agents with highly permissive open source licenses, including:
		- sst/opencode | MIT | ~25k
		- openai/codex | Apache 2.0 | ~42k
		- google/gemini-cli | Apache 2.0 | ~75k
		- Aider-AI/aider | Apache 2.0 | ~38k
	- So my question is: why are we building a new tool instead of using an existing open source tool?
	- If we're prioritizing speed, why not start by just using one of the existing tools and customizing it with our MCP tools, custom prompts, etc. 
	- If that doesn't work, we can just make our own fork of the project. I believe MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses are sufficiently permissive for us to do whatever we want.
	- Opencode is probably the most fully featured and extensible of all the options listed.
