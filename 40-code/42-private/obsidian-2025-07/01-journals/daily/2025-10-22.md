- Working on my second barin
	- Documentation confusion - let's keep everything in a single readme for now. Merge important information from CLAUDE.md into README and delete CLAUDE. Later we can expand into more docs
	- Sources -> Ideas missing link: add this process to the readme - keep it brief for now. Don't focus so much on the current state of the vault (e.g. 9 sources vs. 0 ideas). The goal is to construct an enduring setup and document it in the readme
	- Inbox processing bottleneck: again, just document the process in the readme and keep it brief
	- Same goes for all your other comments. My current goal is to clarify the system and then later I will move on to implementation.
