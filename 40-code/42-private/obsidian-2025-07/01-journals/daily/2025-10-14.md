One of the stated goals is to "Share minimal structure with potential to build upon." Towards this end, I think the documentation should include a section titled "How to build upon this config" including the following:

- Examples of changes you might want to make to existing files: provide at least one example for each existing file
- Examples of new files you might want to add to existing directories: provide at least one example (including file name and content) for each directory
- Examples of new subdirectories you might want to add: provide at least one example for each parent directory
