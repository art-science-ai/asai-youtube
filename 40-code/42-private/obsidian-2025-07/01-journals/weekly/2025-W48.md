- Goals for the week
	- Complete Kavi passport application
		- Must complete - deadline is end of week
		- Mostly done, just need to gather some documents and get a passport photo
		- Estimate ~2 hrs needed
	- v1.0 of my NixOS desktop
		- Estimate: ~2-4 hrs needed (try to do it in 2 by scoping down)
		- Blocker: Need to avoid chasing too many rabbit holes and striving for perfection. Just need a workable desktop setup. Already have a nix flake that just has a few bugs to fix. Should be able to do in 2 hrs.
	- v1.0 of github-gtd plugin
		- Large and ambiguous task, but also likely the most impactful for long term benefit. My end goal is to be able to use this plugin to do all my coding tasks. Already have a working implementation, but many features missing and bugs.
		- Sub-tasks: 
			- define v1.0 
			- implement v1.0
			- define longer term project plan and goals
		- I'll need 4-6 hrs on this project, but I need to be very focused and not spin wheels
- How I can achieve my goals
	- Every day, define specific milestones for the day
	- Every day, spend 4 hrs focus time on weekly goals
	- Day is considered a success when I either spend 4 hrs focus time, or complete the daily milestones 
- What could prevent me from reaching my goals?
	- Yak shaving and chasing down various rabbit holes - trying to optimize / fix my tooling / etc.
