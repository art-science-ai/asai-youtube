# Roadmap: Fabric CLI Learning Lab

## Overview

A hands-on learning journey through Fabric CLI, progressing from installation to practical application. Each phase produces documentation (markdown files) that captures learning outcomes and creates a personal reference guide for future use.

## Domain Expertise

None

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Setup & Installation** - Install Fabric CLI locally and create setup documentation
- [ ] **Phase 2: Pattern Exploration** - Learn available patterns and create a pattern catalog
- [ ] **Phase 3: Hands-On Practice** - Run Fabric commands and document working examples
- [ ] **Phase 4: Use Case Discovery** - Identify personal applications and create usage guide

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Setup & Installation

**Goal**: Fabric CLI installed locally with complete setup documentation

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

**Research**: Likely (new tool installation, potential dependencies)
**Research topics**: Current Fabric installation methods, system requirements, configuration options, authentication setup

**Plans**: 2-3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: Install Fabric CLI and verify installation
- [ ] 01-02: Create setup documentation (SETUP.md with installation steps, configuration, troubleshooting)
- [ ] 01-03: Test basic CLI functionality

### Phase 2: Pattern Exploration

**Goal**: Comprehensive catalog of available Fabric patterns with documentation

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Research**: Likely (need to explore Fabric's pattern ecosystem)
**Research topics**: Available patterns in Fabric, pattern parameters, output formats, pattern use cases

**Plans**: 2-3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Explore and list all available patterns
- [ ] 02-02: Document pattern catalog (PATTERNS.md with descriptions, parameters, examples)
- [ ] 02-03: Test pattern discovery commands

### Phase 3: Hands-On Practice

**Goal**: Collection of working examples demonstrating Fabric CLI usage

**Depends on**: Phase 2

**Research**: Unlikely (using established CLI patterns from Phase 1-2)

**Plans**: 2-3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: Run Fabric commands with various patterns
- [ ] 03-02: Document examples (EXAMPLES.md with real command outputs, use cases, notes)
- [ ] 03-03: Create quick reference guide

### Phase 4: Use Case Discovery

**Goal**: Personal usage guide based on discovered applications

**Depends on**: Phase 3

**Research**: Unlikely (personal reflection on learning)

**Plans**: 2-3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Identify personal use cases through experimentation
- [ ] 04-02: Create usage guide (USAGE.md with personal workflows, integration ideas, best practices)
- [ ] 04-03: Document lessons learned and recommendations

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
