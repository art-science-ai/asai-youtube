# Fabric CLI Learning Lab

## What This Is

A learning playground for exploring and understanding the Fabric CLI (https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric). This is a hands-on experimental space focused on building basic CLI proficiency through daily usage patterns and practical exploration.

## Core Value

Confidence with Fabric CLI commands and patterns — knowing what's available and how to use it effectively for daily tasks.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Install and configure Fabric CLI locally
- [ ] Learn and catalog available Fabric patterns
- [ ] Successfully run basic Fabric commands
- [ ] Create a collection of working examples for reference
- [ ] Identify personal use cases through exploration

### Out of Scope

- Production tools — this is a learning environment, not building production applications
- Internal architecture — not exploring how Fabric works under the hood, just using the CLI
- Custom patterns — using existing patterns, not creating new ones
- Integration with other tools — focused on CLI usage, not API integration

## Context

- Greenfield project in scratch directory for experimentation
- User is approaching this as a learning opportunity with no specific tasks predefined
- Fabric is an AI patterns tool that provides workflows for content processing, summarization, and various text manipulation tasks
- Reference: https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric

## Constraints

- None — this is open-ended exploration with flexibility to follow what's interesting

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Focus on CLI proficiency over building | User wants to learn how to use Fabric effectively before applying it to specific problems | — Pending |
| Exploration-first approach | User doesn't have predefined use cases and wants to discover what's possible through hands-on experimentation | — Pending |
| Single-developer learning project | This is personal skill development, not team collaboration | — Pending |
