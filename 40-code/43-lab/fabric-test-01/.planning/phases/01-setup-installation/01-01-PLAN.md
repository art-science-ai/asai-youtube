<objective>
Install Fabric CLI on the system and create setup documentation in README.md.

Purpose: Get Fabric running locally and document the installation process for future reference. This is the foundation for all subsequent learning phases.

Output: Fabric CLI installed + verified, README.md with Setup section documenting installation commands and decisions

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Install Fabric CLI using nix</name>
  <files>(no files - system installation)</files>
  <action>Install Fabric CLI via nix package manager using imperative command: `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.fabric-ai`. This installs the fabric-ai package from nixpkgs to user profile. DO NOT use curl installer or homebrew - nix is the preferred method per CONTEXT.md. If nix-env fails (e.g., nix not properly configured), STOP and report error - do not fallback to alternative methods without user approval.</action>
  <verify>Command completes successfully without errors. Run `which fabric` to confirm binary is in PATH.</verify>
  <done>fabric-ai package installed to nix user profile, fabric command available in PATH</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify Fabric installation</name>
  <files>(no files - verification only)</files>
  <action>Run `fabric --version` to verify installation succeeded and check installed version. Also run `fabric --help` to confirm command is functional. These commands confirm Fabric is properly installed and ready for use.</action>
  <verify>`fabric --version` outputs version information (e.g., "fabric version x.x.x"). No errors about command not found or missing dependencies.</verify>
  <done>Fabric reports version successfully, help command works, installation confirmed working</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Setup documentation in README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Create or update README.md with a "Setup" section that documents:
1. Installation commands used (nix method as primary)
2. Homebrew fallback for macOS (if nix not available)
3. Verification command
4. Key decisions explained:
   - Why nix: User's preferred package manager, available in nixpkgs as fabric-ai
   - Home Manager options noted (programs.fabric-ai with shell integration options)
   - Why not curl: Less reproducible than nix, outside package management

Section should be practical reference, not comprehensive guide. Use markdown code blocks for commands. Keep it concise - what was done and why.

If README.md doesn't exist, create it with:
- Project title/description
- Setup section (primary deliverable)
- Placeholder sections for future phases (Patterns, Examples, Usage)</action>
  <verify>README.md exists with Setup section containing: nix installation command, homebrew fallback, verification command, decisions explained. Section is readable and accurately reflects what was done.</verify>
  <done>README.md Setup section complete with installation methods documented and key decisions explained</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `fabric --version` runs successfully
- [ ] README.md exists with Setup section
- [ ] Setup section documents nix (primary) and homebrew (fallback) methods
- [ ] Key decisions explained in documentation
- [ ] No errors in installation or verification steps
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Fabric CLI installed and verified working
- README.md contains Setup section with installation journey documented
- Both Linux (nix) and macOS (nix/homebrew) methods covered
- Key decisions captured (why nix, Home Manager options noted, why alternatives are secondary)
- Installation verified with version check
  </success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-setup-installation/01-01-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 1 Plan 1: Setup & Installation Summary

**Fabric CLI installed via nix and documented in README.md**

## Accomplishments

- Fabric CLI installed using `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.fabric-ai`
- Installation verified with `fabric --version`
- README.md Setup section created documenting installation process and decisions

## Files Created/Modified

- `README.md` - Added Setup section with installation commands and decisions

## Decisions Made

- **Nix installation method**: Chose nix over curl/homebrew because it's user's preferred package manager and fabric-ai is available in nixpkgs
- **Home Manager noted**: Documented Home Manager options (programs.fabric-ai) for declarative setup, though not used in this installation
- **Homebrew as fallback**: Documented for macOS users who don't have nix available

## Issues Encountered

None (or describe any installation issues and resolutions)

## Next Step

Phase 1 complete. Ready for Phase 2: Pattern Exploration.
