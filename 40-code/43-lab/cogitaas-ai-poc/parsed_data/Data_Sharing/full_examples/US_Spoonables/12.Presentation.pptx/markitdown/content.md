What is Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF)?
Successfully implemented at

CSF is a strategic factor to help brands identify opportunities to further leverage brand equity for pricing and market share growth.

![Microsoft Customer Story-PepsiCo leverages AI to create an intelligent monitoring system that improves Cheetos consistency](Picture2.jpg)

It captures the surplus perceived by a consumer on account of a brand’s equity advantage in a competitive context.

Helps determine pricing power, competitive risks to brand and its market share potential.

CSF also depends on the type of category, macro-economic factors, substitutes, maturity, consumer trends, discretionary nature

CSF is a measure of value left on the table
How much is a consumer willing to pay Vs. How much are we charging today?

MCV is a measure of $ value of emotional and functional attributes, perceived by consumer
People whose perceived value from brand is less than price charged will not be consumers

People whose perceived value from brand is more than price charged will be consumers

Strategic price recommendation from this analysis triangulates perceived value, competitive advantage and market share potential
Brands with higher surplus i.e. ratio of max perceived value to price will be in a position to gain market share
Brands with higher surplus can also increase price without risk of losing market share

Reading the results: How to determine if a brand should increase or decrease price?

Price Index is calculated as a ratio of Current Price of Kraft to Weighted Price of all available options within a Channel/Retailer (Food / Walmart / Target)

MCV index is calculated as a ratio of MCV of Kraft divided by Weighted MCV of available options to consumer (Food / Walmart / Target)

MCVs (Max. consumer value) indicates the perceived value provided by each brand and so their ratio is used as a benchmark for the recommended index at which to operate

The degree of difference (+ve or –ve) between Price and MCV Index show whether the price index is more than perceived value or not.

If,
MCV index > Price Index = Pricing power   Can increase price
MCV index < Price Index = Overpriced       Can decrease price
MCV index = Price Index = At parity             Can hold price

Executive Summary

<!-- Slide number: 10 -->
Executive Summary: Key Learnings and Recommendations

Overall CSFs are healthy – implying satisfied consumers with low switching tendency

FOOD Channel
Kraft Mayo has significant interaction with Dukes, but Duke’s is offering a higher CSF
This implies that consumers trading down from Hellmanns and up from PL are more likely to switch to Dukes. So, Kraft needs a price cut to arrest value erosion (Primarily in Jars) and stay at 100 SPI to Dukes.

Kraft Aioli has a relatively stronger MCV and CSF – can command ~10% premium in like-to-like packs.
It should hold the current price to and consider expanding to the cheaper Jar packs.

Miracle whip also has a CSF disadvantage vs competition and needs to cut price (in Jars) and stay at 110 SPI to Dukes to protect share.

WALMART Channel
While overall prices and MCVs are lesser than Food; the drop in Kraft’s MCVs are worse than competition – will need cuts across Jars and Squeezy to protect share and stay at a 95 SPI to Dukes.

TARGET Channel
Here, the higher CSF of premium brands is the main threat; will need to maintain an index of 95 to Dukes

<!-- Slide number: 11 -->
Executive Summary: Kraft Mayo should be indexed to Dukes - 100 SPI in Food, 95 in WM, Target; Miracle whip at 110 SPI to Dukes across channels

MSP
Dukes has better CSF and comparable MCV at a price lower than in Kraft in Mayo. Kraft has risk of losing consumers to Dukes (if consumers are downgrading) and to Hellmanns (if consumers are upgrading)
Miracle Whip has a CSF disadvantage as well and hence need to cut price in order to protect MS%
Kraft is stronger in aioli and can maintain its current price

Squeezy bottles have 23% share in food and are relatively expensive than jars

Within Squeezy bottles, 18-22 Oz has a share of 16% and is declining across variants, possibly due to price increase in the range of 4.5%-8%

Almost all PPGs in Whipped Dressing are declining

Kraft has a lower MCV than Dukes but a comparable CSF. There is a risk of loss of share and Kraft should decrease price in Mayo
Whipped Dressing is losing here as well but has lesser threat of further decline than in Food due to better CSF. However, it needs price cut
Kraft is aioli has a strong position both in terms of CSF and MCV. It should continue to hold price to gain from losses in other variants
