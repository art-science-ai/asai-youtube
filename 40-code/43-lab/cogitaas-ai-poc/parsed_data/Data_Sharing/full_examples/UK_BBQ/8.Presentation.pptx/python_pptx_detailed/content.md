Executive Summary – Main takeaways

Overall – Both categories are losing MS in both the channels with Tesco doing better as a channel for the brands

BBQ

Heinz has potential market stability given it’s consolidation at the right price in both the channels
HP in Supermarkets, while offering a similar value proposition to Heinz has a sub-par CSF as compared to HP in Tesco where it is also priced lower to Heinz
A marketing focused approach to set a USP is required for Bull’s eye which has the least CSF in both the channels even after price reductions 


Salad Cream

The price disparity between Private label and Heinz plays a major role in determining the market share headroom in an almost duopolistic market
The category has very less differentiation in terms of channel level CSF of both the channels
The CSF of private label is higher than that of Heinz ; the individual brand level CSF of this category are good
Given the improving MCV trend, Heinz has improved its CSF after price consolidation from last year where as Private Label has increased prices year on year

Supermarkets
Change in: 
Value = -3.8%  Vol. = 0.5% , Price = -4.3% 

UK – BBQ – Market Context - (P52W vs L52W)…..

*Change is 2023 vs 2022; Price is in Euro/kg; Share is in Value terms


Tesco
Change in: 
Value = -3.0%  Vol. = 6.7% , Price = -9.1% 

In Supermarkets, category lost value due to an average price decrease in the present timeframe after consolidating in the previous timeframe whereas in Tesco the loss in value was traded off with gain in volume even after double the average price increase
Heinz is more expensive in Tesco as compared to Supermarkets
HP is priced higher than Heinz in supermarkets and priced lower in Tesco, where it is gaining Market share
Private label is aggressively cutting prices in both the channels, more so in Tesco to set a distinct value proposition as compared to other brands
Sweet Baby Rays is the only brand which is increasing prices and growing in MS in both the channels
The authentic brands (Bulls Eye, Levi roots and Sweet baby rays) are almost priced similar and at premium to core brands indicating a potential premiumization trend

Declining  MCV

Heinz and Private Label continue to be on a downward MCV trend even after price reductions
HP and Bull’s Eye seem to have found a stable MCV in the last two years but their CSF is still below par leaving them little scope to exercise pricing power
Levi Roots and Sweet Baby Rays offer distinct USP but their MCV also fell when they increased prices indicating a price sensitive category
Only ROC maintained a stable MCV because of maintaining stable prices



Stable MCV
