Brand-level Result File Logic for Summary

Identify unique brands within each channel.

For each brand-channel combination, capture the key metrics:

CSF

Price Elasticity (PE)

Market Share (MS)

Market Share Change (MSP)

MCV

Price

Identify all competing brands present in the same channel.

Compare CSF within each channel across brands to determine whether the brand’s CSF is higher or lower compared to competition brand.

CSF Interpretation Rules

High CSF (≥ 2)

Customers show strong loyalty to the brand.

Switching to other brands is low.

Brand is relatively protected from competitive pressure.

Medium CSF (1.7 – 1.9)

Customers display moderate loyalty.

Some switching risk exists if competitors offer better value.

Brand performance depends on pricing and promotions.

Low CSF (< 1.6)

Customers have weak loyalty.

High risk of switching to competing brands.

Brand is vulnerable to price changes and competitive actions.

Relative to Competition

CSF lower than competition: Switching threat exists, even if CSF is high.

CSF equal to competition: Neutral position; outcomes driven by price and promotions.

CSF higher than competition: Loyalty advantage; brand is better protected.





Price Elasticity Interpretation (at a 5% price change)

Less elastic demand (PE ≥ -4)

Customers are less sensitive to price changes.

Price increases are likely to be absorbed.

Limited volume loss expected.

Moderately elastic demand (PE between -5 and -7)

Customers respond noticeably to price changes.

Some volume decline may occur.

Pricing actions should be taken with caution.

Highly elastic demand (PE < -8)

Customers are very price sensitive.

Even small price increases may lead to significant volume loss.

High risk associated with price increases.



Market Share Potential (MSP)

Positive MSP

Zero MSP

Market share is stable.

Brand is maintaining its position within the channel.

Negative MSP
