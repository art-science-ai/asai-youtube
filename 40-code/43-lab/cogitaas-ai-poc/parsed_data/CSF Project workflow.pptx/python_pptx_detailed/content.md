## Slide 3 (1_Title Slide)


Setting a Strategic Price Index using CSF outputs

Optimal strategic price is the outcome of a scenario planner than enables us trade off between:
Market Share Ambition
Volume
Gross or Contribution Margin
Revenue

Impact of Increase in Price Index


## Slide 4 (1_Title Slide)


CSF is a measure of value left on the table

Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF)   = 

Cohort 1

Cohort X

Cohort 2

Value perceived = $8

Value perceived = $15

Value perceived (MAX) = $28

Maximum Consumer Value (MCV)

How much is a consumer willing to pay Vs. How much are we charging today?

MCV is a measure of $ value of emotional and functional attributes, perceived by consumer

People whose perceived value from brand is more than price charged will be consumers


People whose perceived value from brand is less than price charged will not be consumers


Price to consumer

Different cohorts of consumers will perceive different value from brand


## Slide 5 (1_Title Slide)


Brands with higher CSF can lead price increase and/or target higher market share

Brands with higher surplus can also increase price without risk of losing market share

Cohort X

MCV = $24

Brand XYZ
is the best!

Cohort Y

MCV = $16

Strategic price recommendation from this analysis triangulates perceived value, competitive advantage and market share potential

Brands with higher surplus i.e. ratio of max perceived value to price will be in a position to gain market share

Price = $10

CSF = 2.4

Can increase price by 12% without risking share loss
Has potential to gain 3% market share

Price = $10

CSF = 1.6

Will lose share
Will need to reduce price
