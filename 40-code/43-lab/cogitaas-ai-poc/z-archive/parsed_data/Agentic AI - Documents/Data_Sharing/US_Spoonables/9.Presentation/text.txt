Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF) studyKraft Heinz – Spoonables17 January 2025
CSF Introduction
What is Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF)?
Based on analysis of real consumer behaviour data (Sales)
Developed through research collaboration with academics from Columbia University
Derived from multi-brand econometric analysis to arrive at consumer loyalty
Successfully implemented at 












CSF is a measure of value left on the table
Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF)   = 
Cohort 1
Cohort X
Cohort 2
Value perceived = $8
Value perceived = $15
Value perceived (MAX) = $28
Maximum Consumer Value (MCV)
How much is a consumer willing to pay Vs. How much are we charging today?
MCV is a measure of $ value of emotional and functional attributes, perceived by consumer
People whose perceived value from brand is more than price charged will be consumers




People whose perceived value from brand is less than price charged will not be consumers

Price to consumer
Different cohorts of consumers will perceive different value from brand
Brands with higher CSF can lead price increase and/or target higher market share
Brands with higher surplus can also increase price without risk of losing market share
Cohort X
MCV = $24
Brand XYZ
is the best!
Cohort Y
MCV = $16
Strategic price recommendation from this analysis triangulates perceived value, competitive advantage and market share potential
Brands with higher surplus i.e. ratio of max perceived value to price will be in a position to gain market share



Price = $10
CSF = 2.4
Can increase price by 12% without risking share loss
Has potential to gain 3% market share
Price = $10
CSF = 1.6
Will lose share
Will need to reduce price

*Mayo includes unflavoured + olive flavoured + avocado flavoured
Percentages are value MS% for 2024 YTD (Jan-Nov)
Reading the results: How to determine if a brand should increase or decrease price?

Price Index is calculated as a ratio of Current Price of Kraft to Weighted Price of all available options within a Channel/Retailer (Food / Walmart / Target)
MCV index is calculated as a ratio of MCV of Kraft divided by Weighted MCV of available options to consumer (Food / Walmart / Target)

MCVs (Max. consumer value) indicates the perceived value provided by each brand and so their ratio is used as a benchmark for the recommended index at which to operate
The degree of difference (+ve or –ve) between Price and MCV Index show whether the price index is more than perceived value or not. 

If, 
MCV index > Price Index = Pricing power   Can increase price
MCV index < Price Index = Overpriced       Can decrease price
MCV index = Price Index = At parity             Can hold price



Executive Summary
Executive Summary: Key Learnings and Recommendations
Overall CSFs are healthy – implying satisfied consumers with low switching tendency

FOOD Channel
Kraft Mayo has significant interaction with Dukes, but Duke’s is offering a higher CSF
This implies that consumers trading down from Hellmanns and up from PL are more likely to switch to Dukes. So, Kraft needs a price cut to arrest value erosion (Primarily in Jars) and stay at 100 SPI to Dukes.

Kraft Aioli has a relatively stronger MCV and CSF – can command ~10% premium in like-to-like packs.
It should hold the current price to and consider expanding to the cheaper Jar packs.

Miracle whip also has a CSF disadvantage vs competition and needs to cut price (in Jars) and stay at 110 SPI to Dukes to protect share.

WALMART Channel
While overall prices and MCVs are lesser than Food; the drop in Kraft’s MCVs are worse than competition – will need cuts across Jars and Squeezy to protect share and stay at a 95 SPI to Dukes.

TARGET Channel
Here, the higher CSF of premium brands is the main threat; will need to maintain an index of 95 to Dukes
Executive Summary: Kraft Mayo should be indexed to Dukes - 100 SPI in Food, 95 in WM, Target; Miracle whip at 110 SPI to Dukes across channels

Sales through Food : 66%Change in Category : 
Value = +3.9%
Volume = +1.7%
Price = +2.2%
Summary of change in market share and price across brands and variants
Food channel has grown in value, volume and price

Except Kraft and Miracle Whip, all the brands have either grown or are stable

At a variant level, Whipped Dressing has lost volume and value share to both Mayo and Aioli

While Mayo is growing, Kraft is losing maximum share here

Kraft is stable in Aioli
Food: Although KHC brands’ CSFs are healthy at ~2, competition CSFS are higher at ~2.2
In mayo, Kraft faces challenge Dukes in the mid-tier price segment
Dukes has better CSF and comparable MCV at a price lower than in Kraft in Mayo. Kraft has risk of losing consumers to Dukes (if consumers are downgrading) and to Hellmanns (if consumers are upgrading)
Miracle Whip has a CSF disadvantage as well and hence need to cut price in order to protect MS%
Kraft is stronger in aioli and can maintain its current price

Summary of change in market share and price across brands  variants X PPG
70% of the total PPGs value is in jars

Within Jars, 30 Oz has the largest val. share at 53%

Squeezy bottles have 23% share in food and are relatively expensive than jars 

Within Squeezy bottles, 18-22 Oz has a share of 16% and is declining across variants, possibly due to price increase in the range of 4.5%-8%

Almost all PPGs in Whipped Dressing are declining 
Please note: All non-KHC PPGs contributing < 1% to the overall channel have been excluded from representation on the slides. For KHC brands, all PPG contributing more than 0.5% to the respective brands have been shown.









Food: Mayo & WD 30 Oz Jar face maximum risk and needs to cut price 
Kraft’s 30 Oz variant is facing the maximum risk of loss of share. Dukes in the same price range has a better CSF and a slightly better MCV. Similar competition from Hellman’s as well. This PPG requires price cut to protect loss of share
Kraft should consider expanding presence of Aioli in 30oz Jars – at a

Summary of change in market share and price across brands and variants
Both Mayo & Whipped Dressing are losing share to Aioli in value and volume

Kraft is strong in Aioli in both CSF & MCV. In mayo, it faces risk from Dukes
The best CSF is offered by Premium brands sitting in ‘Rest of Category’
Kraft has a lower MCV than Dukes but a comparable CSF. There is a risk of loss of share and Kraft should decrease price in Mayo
Whipped Dressing is losing here as well but has lesser threat of further decline than in Food due to better CSF. However, it needs price cut
Kraft is aioli has a strong position both in terms of CSF and MCV. It should continue to hold price to gain from losses in other variants
