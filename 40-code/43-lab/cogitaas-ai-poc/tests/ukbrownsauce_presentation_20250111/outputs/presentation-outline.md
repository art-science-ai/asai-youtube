## Slide 2: Executive Summary

### Overall Market
- CSFs healthy across Supermarket (2.25), Tesco (2.25), and Convenience (2.22)
- Iceland CSFs relatively lower (1.76) due to price-sensitive consumers
- HP dominates across all channels with 61-99% market share

### HP Brown Sauce (Market Leader)
- CSF: 2.22-2.25 (high) across Supermarket, Tesco, Convenience
- CSF: 1.76 (medium) in Iceland - more competitive channel

- Market share: Leader in all 4 channels (61-99%)
- Trend: Gaining share in Iceland (+0.27%), Tesco (+0.37%), Supermarket (+0.30%)
- Recommendation: Room for modest price increases in Convenience (only brand, inelastic demand). Hold prices in Supermarket/Tesco. Cautious in Iceland.

### Competition
- Private Label has strongest CSF in Supermarket (2.30) and Tesco (2.44)
- Limited price interaction with HP - reduces immediate switching risk
