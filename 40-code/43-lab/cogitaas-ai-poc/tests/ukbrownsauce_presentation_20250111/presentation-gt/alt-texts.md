The Infosys Consulting logo appears in the bottom right corner.

## Slide 2

Executive Summary slide with text-heavy content organized in sections. The slide contains bullet points covering Overall findings (healthy CSFs in Supermarket, Tesco & Convenience channels; lower Iceland CSFs), HP Brown Sauce analysis (retains pricing power, less likely to switch when prices increase, only brand in Convenience channel with channel price elasticity of -0.82), Competition section (Private Label has strongest CSF despite 7-10% price increases), and PPG section (discontinuation of Large Variant except for HP). Text is formatted in black with bold headers and italicized emphasis on key terms.

## Slide 3

Market context tables showing Brown Sauce performance across four retail channels (Supermarkets, Tesco, Iceland, Convenience) for two time periods (Mar'23-Feb'24 vs Mar'24-Feb'25). Each channel section displays data for HP and competitor brands (Small, Medium, Large variants for most; DADDIES, BRANSTON, PRIVATE LABEL, GOLD STAR) with columns for M5% (market share), % Change, Avg. Price, and % Change. Values are highlighted in red (negative changes) and green (positive changes). The right side contains bullet-point observations about HP's market position, noting stable share in Supermarkets/Tesco, distribution loss in Iceland Medium Variant, and increasing Medium Variant market share overall.

## Slide 4

Stacked bar chart comparing CSF & MCV trends across three time periods (Feb 2023, Feb 2024, Feb 2025) for four brands (HP, DADDIES, BRANSTON, PRIVATE LABEL) in Supermarket channel.

## Slide 6

Six-panel layout showing pricing power analysis across three channels (Supermarket, Tesco, Iceland), with two charts per channel. Top row shows "MSH & CMA AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" with dual-axis line graphs displaying market share (yellow line decreasing, maroon line increasing) plotted against price, with current and inflection price points marked by vertical dashed lines. Specific prices and RPI values are shown in colored boxes. Bottom row shows "VOLUME & NSV AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" with volume (cyan) decreasing and NSV (pink) relatively stable lines. Legend indicates L12M (maroon dashed line) and Inflection (green dashed line). Title indicates HP has pricing power across all three channels.

## Slide 7

Stacked bar chart analysis for Supermarket channel showing three product size segments (Small 11.3% Val. MS, Medium 64.9%, Large 21.9%). Each segment compares HP against competitors (BRANSTON for Small, DADDIES and PRIVATE LABEL for Medium and Large). Bars use the standard color scheme: red for Price, orange for CSF, yellow for competitors' CSF, blue for MCV. Below the charts is a performance table showing C.MS% (market share), MSP (in green/pink), and RPI metrics. Key insights note that HP's growth comes from Medium Variant, while Small can cut prices slightly. The title emphasizes HP Medium has healthy CSF while Small PPG can reduce prices.

## Slide 8

Three-panel layout showing price elasticity analysis for Supermarket Medium PPG across Small, Medium, and Large size segments. Each panel contains two vertically stacked charts showing "MSH & CMA AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" (top) and "VOLUME & NSV AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" (bottom). The dual-axis line graphs show market share changes (yellow and maroon lines) and volume/NSV trends (cyan and pink lines) relative to price points. Current and inflection prices are marked with vertical dashed lines. The Medium panel shows Price 5.97 (current) vs 6.71 (inflection). Legend shows L12M and Inflection markers. Title indicates Medium PPG should be the major driver in increasing overall brand prices.

## Slide 9

Stacked bar chart for Tesco channel showing two size segments (Small 8.4% Val. MS, Medium 70.6%, Large 20.3%). Compares HP performance against competitors (HP for Small/Medium, DADDIES and PRIVATE LABEL for Medium/Large). Color scheme consistent: red (Price), orange (CSF), yellow (competitor CSF), blue (MCV). Performance metrics table below shows C.MS%, MSP, RPI, and Inflection RPI. HP Small shows 8.4% market share, Medium shows 51.2%, Large shows 20.3%. Key insights indicate HP's growth will come from Medium Variant, with Large able to cut prices slightly (RPI increased from 104 to 111). Title emphasizes HP Medium has healthy CSF while Large PPG can reduce prices.

## Slide 10

Three-panel price elasticity chart for Tesco Large PPG showing Small, Medium, and Large segments. Each panel has dual charts: top shows "MSH & CMA AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" with intersecting market share lines (yellow declining, maroon increasing), bottom shows "VOLUME & NSV AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" with volume (cyan) and NSV (pink) trends. Vertical dashed lines mark current vs inflection price points. Large panel shows Price 4.8 (green) vs 5.48 (red) at inflection. Legend distinguishes L12M (maroon dashed) and Inflection (green dashed). Title indicates Large PPG needs price reduction while Small and Medium can increase prices.

## Slide 11

Stacked bar chart for Iceland channel showing two size segments (Medium 47.0%, Large 46.5%). Compares HP against DADDIES and GOLD STAR using standard color scheme. Performance table shows C.MS% (18.5% Medium HP, 28.5% DADDIES, 43.0% Large HP, 3.5% GOLD STAR), MSP values (pink/green highlighting), RPI metrics (134, 86, 130, 43), and Inflection RPI. Key insights note HP Medium PPG facing distribution loss causing decreased market share, while Large PPG increased distribution. Both brands (Daddies and Gold Star) show increased RPI to Category. Title emphasizes Gold Star has highest CSF in Iceland with strong competitive position.

## Slide 12

Two-panel price elasticity analysis for Iceland showing Medium and Large segments. Each panel contains dual stacked charts: "MSH & CMA AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" (top) showing market share crossover between yellow (declining) and maroon (increasing) lines, and "VOLUME & NSV AT CURRENT PRICE AND AT INFLECTION POINT" (bottom) showing volume (cyan) and NSV (pink) trends. Vertical dashed lines separate current from inflection price zones. Medium shows Price 5.83 (green), Large shows 5.66 (red) vs 5.72 (green). Legend indicates L12M (maroon dashed) and Inflection (green dashed). Title states both PPGs can retain current prices to avoid volume loss.

## Slide 13
