- Expected Impact: +£600K-£900K annual revenue with minimal volume loss
- Timeline: Phase implementation over 2 quarters starting Q1
- Risk: Competitive response, set rollback thresholds at 2% volume decline

**Bulls Eye Strategic Decision**
- Situation: Critical with low CSF (1.68-1.63) and high elasticity (-7.30 to -7.93)
- Option A: Reposition as value brand with 5-10% price reduction
- Option B: Major brand investment to improve CSF (12-18 month timeline)
- Option C: Exit strategy from underperforming channels
- Decision Required: Within 1 quarter
- Risk of Inaction: Continued share loss, brand viability threatened

### Risk Mitigation Framework

**Competitive Response Risk**
- Mitigation: Phase implementation, monitor competitor reactions weekly
- Trigger: Competitive price cuts within 2 weeks of our changes
- Response: Promotional support rather than price rollbacks

**Volume Loss Risk**
- Mitigation: Set clear thresholds (2% volume decline triggers review)
- Monitoring: Weekly volume tracking during price change periods
- Response: Rollback to previous pricing or increase promotional support

**Promotional Escalation Risk**
- Mitigation: Maintain promotional discipline, avoid price wars
- Monitoring: Promotional frequency and depth tracking
- Response: Strategic promotional response, not reactive

**Channel Specificity Risk**
- Mitigation: Clear channel-specific strategies, avoid one-size-fits-all
- Monitoring: Channel-specific performance tracking
- Response: Adjust channel-specific approaches based on performance

### Key Success Factors
1. Execution discipline: Follow phased implementation approach
2. Monitoring rigor: Weekly performance tracking during implementation
3. Competitive intelligence: Continuous monitoring of competitor actions
4. Flexibility: Willingness to adjust based on market response
5. Patience: Allow sufficient time for market to respond to changes

### Next Steps
