## Slide 4

### Layout Structure
The infographic uses a **dual-panel layout** (Cohort X on the left, Cohort Y on the right) to compare two brands (ABC and XYZ) across key business metrics. Each panel is structured as a **pyramid** (representing market segments or customer tiers) with a clear vertical hierarchy:

- **Top**: Brand messaging (e.g., "Brand ABC is the best!") and strategic outcomes (e.g., "Can increase price by 12%").
- **Middle**: Pyramid layers (visualizing market segments) with icons of people (customers).
- **Bottom**: Price and CSF (Customer Surplus Factor) metrics, plus MCV (Maximum Customer Value).

### Color Style
- **Price**: Bright green (consistent across both panels, e.g., "Price = $10").
- **CSF**: Black (bold, e.g., "CSF = 2.4" for Cohort X, "CSF = 1.6" for Cohort Y).
- **MCV**: Blue (e.g., "MCV = $24" for Cohort X, "MCV = $16" for Cohort Y).
- **Background**: White (clean, emphasizing data).
- **Pyramid layers**: Light blue (subtle, separating segments).

### Main Components & Text Content

#### 1. Title
- **Top-center**: "Brands with higher CSF can lead price increase and/or target higher market share" (bold, dark blue).

#### 2. Cohort X (Left Panel: Brand ABC)
- **Brand Messaging**: "Brand ABC is the best!" (white box, black text).
- **Strategic Outcomes**:
  - "Can increase price by 12% without risking share loss" (black text, right arrow).
  - "Has potential to gain 3% market share" (black text, right arrow).
- **Metrics**:
  - "Cohort X" (black text, top-left).
  - "MCV = $24" (blue text, below "Cohort X").
  - "CSF = 2.4" (black text, left of pyramid).
  - "Price = $10" (green text, bottom-left).
- **Pyramid**: 4 layers (light blue) with human icons (increasing in number from top to bottom, representing broader market segments).

#### 3. Cohort Y (Right Panel: Brand XYZ)
- **Brand Messaging**: "Brand XYZ is the best!" (white box, black text).
- **Strategic Outcomes**:
  - "Will lose share" (black text, right arrow).
  - "Will need to reduce price" (black text, right arrow).
- **Metrics**:
  - "Cohort Y" (black text, top-left).
  - "MCV = $16" (blue text, below "Cohort Y").
  - "CSF = 1.6" (black text, left of pyramid).
  - "Price = $10" (green text, bottom-left).
- **Pyramid**: 4 layers (light blue) with human icons (similar structure to Cohort X, but fewer icons per layer).

#### 4. Bottom Quotes (3 text boxes)
- **Left**: "Strategic price recommendation from this analysis triangulates perceived value, competitive advantage and market share potential" (black text, quotation marks).
- **Middle**: "Brands with higher surplus i.e. ratio of max perceived value to price will be in a position to gain market share" (black text, quotation marks).
- **Right**: "Brands with higher surplus can also increase price without risk of losing market share" (black text, quotation marks).

### Chart Types & Data Visualization Elements
- **Pyramids**: Stacked, hierarchical visualizations of market segments (customers). The number of human icons per layer increases from top to bottom, implying broader reach in lower tiers.
- **Metrics**: Direct text labels (no separate charts) for Price, CSF, and MCV, with color-coding for clarity.
- **Arrows**: Connect brand messaging to strategic outcomes (e.g., "Can increase price by 12%").

### Business Metrics & Key Data Points
- **CSF (Customer Surplus Factor)**: Higher values (2.4 for ABC vs. 1.6 for XYZ) correlate with pricing power and market share growth.
- **MCV (Maximum Customer Value)**: Higher MCV ($24 for ABC vs. $16 for XYZ) indicates stronger perceived value.
- **Price**: Both brands start at $10, but ABC can raise prices (12% increase) without losing share, while XYZ must reduce prices.
- **Market Share**: ABC has potential to gain 3% share; XYZ will lose share.

### Trends & Layout Hierarchy
- **Hierarchy**: Title → Cohort X (left) → Cohort Y (right) → Quotes (bottom).
- **Trend**: Higher CSF (ABC) enables price increases and market share growth; lower CSF (XYZ) forces price reductions and share loss.
- **Visual Flow**: Pyramids guide the eye from top (brand messaging) to bottom (metrics), with arrows emphasizing strategic outcomes.

### Summary
The infographic uses a clean, color-coded dual-panel layout to contrast two brands' performance. Pyramids visualize market segments, while metrics (CSF, MCV, Price) and strategic outcomes highlight how higher CSF drives pricing power and market share. The design emphasizes clarity, with color-coding (green for Price, blue for MCV, black for CSF) and hierarchical structure to communicate business insights effectively.

## Slide 5

### Layout Structure
The slide uses a **hierarchical, pyramid-based layout** to organize content, with a clear top-down flow:
1. **Title & Subtitle**: At the top, a bold title ("CSF is a measure of value left on the table") and a blue banner subtitle ("How much is a consumer willing to pay Vs. How much are we charging today?") frame the core question.
2. **Pyramid Visualization**: The central element is a **triangular pyramid** divided into three horizontal "cohorts" (Cohort X, Cohort, Cohort) representing different consumer segments.
3. **Formula & Annotations**: To the right of the pyramid, a formula box defines the **Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF)**, with arrows linking to the pyramid's "Maximum Customer Value (MCV)" and "Price to consumer" metrics.
4. **Quote Boxes**: At the bottom, three rectangular quote boxes (with quotation marks) provide definitions and behavioral insights.

### Color Style
Colors are strategically used to differentiate key metrics and cohorts:
- **Blue**: Represents "Maximum Customer Value (MCV)" (e.g., the top cohort's "Value perceived (MAX) = $28" and the MCV box).
- **Green**: Represents "Price to consumer" (e.g., the horizontal line labeled "Price to consumer" and the formula's denominator).
- **Red/Orange**: Represents cohorts with low perceived value (e.g., the bottom cohort's "Value perceived = $8" and the quote box about non-consumers).
- **Neutral Grays**: Used for text labels (e.g., "Cohort X," "Value perceived") and icons.

### Main Components & Text Content

#### 1. Title & Subtitle
- **Title**: "CSF is a measure of value left on the table" (bold, dark blue, large font).
- **Subtitle**: "How much is a consumer willing to pay Vs. How much are we charging today?" (white text on a blue banner, smaller font).

#### 2. Pyramid Visualization (Central Element)
- **Structure**: A triangular pyramid divided into three horizontal "cohorts" (top to bottom):
  - **Cohort X (Top)**: Purple icons (consumers) with "Value perceived (MAX) = $28" (blue text).
  - **Middle Cohort**: Teal icons with "Value perceived = $15" (gray text).
  - **Bottom Cohort**: Red icons with "Value perceived = $8" (gray text).
- **Annotation**: Left of the pyramid: "Different cohorts of consumers will perceive different value from brand" (gray text).

#### 3. Formula & Metrics (Right of Pyramid)
- **Formula**: "Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF) = Max Consumer value (MCV) / Price to consumer" (black text).
- **Arrows**: A vertical arrow links "Maximum Customer Value (MCV)" (blue box) to the formula; a horizontal arrow links "Price to consumer" (green text) to the formula.

#### 4. Quote Boxes (Bottom)
Three rectangular boxes with quotation marks (gray borders) provide context:
- **Left Box**: "MCV is a measure of $ value of emotional and functional attributes, perceived by consumer" (black text).
- **Middle Box**: "People whose perceived value from brand is less than price charged will not be consumers" (red text for "less than price charged").
- **Right Box**: "People whose perceived value from brand is more than price charged will be consumers" (green text for "more than price charged").

### Chart Types & Data Visualization Elements
- **Pyramid Chart**: The central visualization is a **stacked pyramid** (triangular) with three cohorts, where:
  - Cohort size (number of icons) decreases from top to bottom (reflecting fewer consumers with high perceived value).
  - Color coding (purple/teal/red) differentiates cohorts by perceived value.
- **Formula Box**: A simple text-based formula (no chart) to define CSF.
- **Icons**: Human icons (purple/teal/red) represent consumers in each cohort, with size/quantity indicating cohort size.

### Business Metrics & Key Data Points
- **Maximum Customer Value (MCV)**: The highest perceived value (Cohort X: $28), representing the "emotional/functional attributes" consumers value (per the left quote box).
- **Price to Consumer**: The price charged (green text), used as the denominator in the CSF formula.
- **Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF)**: A ratio of MCV to price, measuring "value left on the table" (i.e., unmonetized consumer value).
- **Cohort Perceived Value**: Three data points: $28 (Cohort X), $15 (middle), $8 (bottom), showing variation in how consumers value the brand.

### Trends & Layout Hierarchy
- **Hierarchy**: The title/subtitle frame the core question; the pyramid (central) visualizes cohorts; the formula (right) defines the metric; quote boxes (bottom) provide context.
- **Trend**: Cohort perceived value decreases from top to bottom (from $28 to $8), implying fewer consumers will purchase as perceived value drops below the price (per the middle quote box).
- **Color Hierarchy**: Blue (MCV) > Green (Price) > Red (Low Value) guides attention to the most critical metrics.

### Summary
The slide uses a pyramid to visualize consumer cohorts by perceived value, a formula to define CSF, and color-coded text/quotes to explain business logic. Key metrics (MCV, Price, CSF) are linked to behavioral insights (who becomes a consumer), with a clear hierarchy that prioritizes the "value left on the table" concept.

## Slide 6

### Layout Structure
The image is a **vertical flowchart** with a clear hierarchical structure, organized as a single-column list of three objectives. Each objective is enclosed in a rectangular text box, connected by a vertical line to a circular icon (representing a visual cue for the objective). The layout is left-aligned, with icons on the left and text boxes extending to the right, creating a clean, scannable format.

### Color Style
- **Primary Color**: A deep, professional blue (#0066CC or similar) is used for icons, text, and connecting lines, conveying trust and clarity.
- **Background**: White, ensuring high contrast for readability.
- **Text**: Black for standard text, with key terms (e.g., "relative competitive advantage," "strategic price index," "scenario planning") highlighted in **bold blue** to emphasize critical business metrics.

### Main Components
1. **Title**: "Objective of a Consumer Surplus Factor (CSF) study" at the top, in bold blue, setting the context.
2. **Icons**: Three circular icons (each with a distinct symbol) aligned vertically, serving as visual anchors for each objective:
   - Top: Hand with upward/downward arrows (suggesting comparison/advantage).
   - Middle: Price tag (representing pricing strategy).
   - Bottom: Calendar with a pencil (indicating planning/scenario analysis).
3. **Text Boxes**: Three rectangular boxes, each containing a bullet-point-style objective, with icons connected via thin blue lines to the boxes.

### Text Content
Each text box includes a concise objective, with key business metrics highlighted in bold:
1. **Top Box**: "Determine **relative competitive advantage** and market share headroom at relevant granularity vs competition"
   - Focus: Competitive positioning and market opportunity.
2. **Middle Box**: "Develop a **strategic price index** vs critical competitors by brand, segment or channel"
   - Focus: Pricing strategy and competitor benchmarking.
3. **Bottom Box**: "Have a long-term planning tool that enables **scenario planning** basis price modulation"
   - Focus: Strategic planning and price sensitivity analysis.

### Chart Types & Data Visualization Elements
- **No traditional charts** (e.g., bar graphs, line charts) are present. Instead, the design uses **iconography** and **text hierarchy** to communicate objectives.
- **Visual Cues**: Icons act as metaphors (hand = comparison, price tag = pricing, calendar = planning), simplifying complex business concepts.

### Business Metrics & Key Data Points
- **Relative Competitive Advantage**: A core metric for assessing how a brand outperforms competitors (e.g., via price, quality, or value).
- **Market Share Headroom**: The potential to grow market share, derived from competitive analysis.
- **Strategic Price Index**: A custom index to compare a brand's pricing against competitors, segmented by brand/segment/channel.
- **Scenario Planning**: A tool for modeling outcomes under different price modulation scenarios (e.g., price increases/decreases).

### Layout Hierarchy
- **Title**: Most prominent (largest font, bold).
- **Icons**: Second in hierarchy (visually distinct, left-aligned).
- **Text Boxes**: Third (clear, readable font, with key terms emphasized).

### Summary
The design prioritizes **clarity** and **actionability**, using a vertical flowchart to outline three strategic objectives of a CSF study. Blue accents (icons, bold text) unify the visual language, while icons and text hierarchy guide the viewer through competitive analysis, pricing strategy, and long-term planning—core business metrics for market optimization. No charts are used, but iconography and text structure effectively communicate the study's purpose.

The image presents a **6-panel dashboard** analyzing pricing strategies for three condiment categories—Mayo, Whipped Dressing, and Aioli—using dual-panel layouts (top: price/elasticity metrics; bottom: volume/NSV metrics). The title emphasizes a business strategy: *"Cut price in mayo & whipped dressing. Aioli can maintain its price"*. Below is a detailed breakdown:

### **Overall Layout & Color Coding**
- **Columns**: Three sections (Mayo, Whipped Dressing, Aioli), each with two vertically stacked panels.
- **Color Coding**:
  - **Red**: Price-related metrics (e.g., MSP, CMA, RPI).
  - **Yellow**: Volume/NSV metrics (e.g., volume, NSV).
  - **Blue**: Background for Mayo; orange for Whipped Dressing; light blue for Aioli (to distinguish categories).

### **Top Panels: Price & Elasticity Metrics**
Each top panel uses **line graphs** to show two key metrics:
1. **MSP & CMA at Current Price and at Inflection Point** (left y-axis: percentage change; right y-axis: percentage change).
2. **Price, RPI, and Category (Cat) Numbers** (labeled data points).

#### **Mayo (Blue Background)**
- **Lines**:
  - **Red**: Decreasing curve (e.g., from 3.28 to 3.06, labeled "Price-3.06 RPI to Cat-90").
  - **Yellow**: Increasing curve (e.g., from 3.28 to 3.06, labeled "Price-3.28 RPI to Cat-96").
- **Trend**: Price cuts (red) reduce RPI (retailer price index) and shift category positioning (Cat-90 vs. Cat-96), indicating elasticity.

#### **Whipped Dressing (Orange Background)**
- **Lines**:
  - **Red**: Decreasing curve (e.g., from 3.64 to 3.30, labeled "Price-3.30 RPI to Cat-97").
  - **Yellow**: Increasing curve (e.g., from 3.64 to 3.64, labeled "Price-3.64 RPI to Cat-107").
- **Trend**: Similar to Mayo, price cuts (red) lower RPI and adjust category positioning (Cat-97 vs. Cat-107).

#### **Aioli (Light Blue Background)**
- **Lines**:
  - **Red**: Decreasing curve (e.g., from 6.09 to 6.04, labeled "Price-6.04 RPI to Cat-177").
  - **Yellow**: Increasing curve (e.g., from 6.09 to 6.09, labeled "Price-6.09 RPI to Cat-179").
- **Trend**: Minimal price change (red vs. yellow) suggests inelastic demand—Aioli can maintain price without losing RPI or category positioning.

### **Bottom Panels: Volume & NSV Metrics**
Each bottom panel uses **line graphs** to show:
1. **Volume & NSV at Current Price and at Inflection Point** (left y-axis: percentage change; right y-axis: percentage change).
2. **Volume/NSV Trends** (curves for current vs. inflection price).

#### **Mayo (Blue Background)**
- **Lines**:
  - **Red**: Decreasing curve (volume/NSV at current price).
  - **Yellow**: Increasing curve (volume/NSV at inflection price).
- **Trend**: Price cuts (inflection point) boost volume/NSV (yellow > red), supporting elasticity.

#### **Whipped Dressing (Orange Background)**
- **Lines**:
  - **Red**: Decreasing curve (volume/NSV at current price).
  - **Yellow**: Increasing curve (volume/NSV at inflection price).
- **Trend**: Price cuts increase volume/NSV, aligning with Mayo's strategy.

#### **Aioli (Light Blue Background)**
- **Lines**:
  - **Red**: Decreasing curve (volume/NSV at current price).
  - **Yellow**: Increasing curve (volume/NSV at inflection price).
- **Trend**: Even with price stability, volume/NSV remains high (red ≈ yellow), confirming inelastic demand.

### **Business Metrics & Data Points**
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **MSP (Manufacturer Selling Price)**: Manufacturer's price.
  - **CMA (Category Margin Adjustment)**: Margin changes.
  - **RPI (Retailer Price Index)**: Retailer pricing.
  - **NSV (Net Sales Value)**: Revenue.
  - **Volume**: Unit sales.
- **Data Points**:
  - Mayo: Price cuts from 3.28 → 3.06 (RPI: Cat-96 → Cat-90); Whipped Dressing: 3.64 → 3.30 (RPI: Cat-107 → Cat-97); Aioli: 6.09 → 6.04 (RPI: Cat-179 → Cat-177).
  - Volume/NSV: Inflection price (yellow) > current price (red) for Mayo/Whipped Dressing; stable for Aioli.

### **Trends & Strategy**
- **Mayo/Whipped Dressing**: Price cuts (red lines) increase volume/NSV (yellow lines), justifying elasticity-driven price reductions.
- **Aioli**: Price stability (minimal red/yellow difference) maintains volume/NSV, supporting the strategy to "maintain its price."

### **Chart Types & Design**
- **Line Graphs**: Show trends over "End Consumer Price" (x-axis).
- **Dual Y-Axes**: Left (percentage change for price/elasticity); right (percentage change for volume/NSV).
- **Color Coding**: Red (price), yellow (volume/NSV), blue/orange/light blue (category backgrounds) for clarity.

### Summary
This dashboard effectively communicates a data-driven pricing strategy, using visual trends and metrics to justify cuts for Mayo/Whipped Dressing and stability for Aioli.
