## Slide 2: Executive Summary

### Overall Market
The US spoonables market demonstrates strong customer loyalty across all channels, with all brands showing high CSF values (2.0-4.5). The market is characterized by moderate price elasticity, indicating customers notice price changes but remain relatively loyal. Walmart shows the highest price sensitivity (least elastic brands), while the food channel demonstrates more varied competitive dynamics.

### Hellmann's Best Foods (Market Leader, 37.5% aggregate share)
- CSF: 2.20-3.70 (high) - Strong customer loyalty with protected position from competitive pressure
- Price elasticity: -3.97 to -4.15 (less to moderately elastic) - Low to moderate price sensitivity, pricing power varies by channel
- Market share trend: gaining in food (+0.39%) and walmart (+0.56%), losing in target (-0.31%)
- Recommendation: Selective price increases in food and walmart channels where elasticity is lower; maintain target pricing

### Kraft (Challenger, 9.6% aggregate share)
- CSF: 2.07-3.39 (high) - Strong loyalty base but losing competitive position
- Price elasticity: -4.35 to -4.66 (moderately elastic) - Moderately price sensitive
- Market share trend: losing share across all channels (food -0.32%, target -0.12%, walmart -0.49%)
- Recommendation: Address share loss with promotional support before price increases; investigate competitive threats

### Private Label (Growing Competitor, 10.2% aggregate share)
- CSF: 2.18-2.35 (high) - Strong value positioning resonating with customers
- Price elasticity: -3.71 to -4.23 (less to moderately elastic) - More resilient to price changes than expected
- Market share trend: gaining in food (+0.17%) and walmart (+0.55%), stable in target
- Recommendation: Opportune timing for modest price increases; capitalize on positive momentum

### Competition
Hellmann's dominates with 37.5% aggregate market share, followed by private label (10.2%) and Kraft (9.6%). Private label shows surprising strength with high CSF and positive momentum, particularly in walmart (+0.55%). Restofcategory demonstrates competitive advantages in target and walmart with higher-than-average CSF positions. Miracle whip shows concerning trends with lower-than-average competitive positions and share loss across channels.

### Key Recommendations
1. Hellmann's: Implement 2-3% price increases in food and walmart channels where elasticity supports it; hold pricing in target
2. Kraft: Prioritize share stabilization through promotional investment and differentiation; defer price increases
3. Private label: Execute 3-4% price increases across channels to capture value while momentum is positive
4. Monitor private label competitive pressure, particularly in walmart where share gains are strongest
5. Investigate miracle whip and kraft share losses to understand competitive dynamics

### Risk Considerations

**Competitive Risks**

- Value-conscious segment growth could pressure premium brands
- Retailer pressure on price increases, especially in walmart

**Execution Risks**
- Price increases may trigger competitive responses
- Economic downturn could amplify price sensitivity
- Supply chain constraints may limit promotional effectiveness

**Monitoring Requirements**
- Track private label share growth monthly
- Monitor kraft and miracle whip share trends closely
- Measure price increase volume impacts weekly
- Competitive intelligence on pricing actions

### Long-Term Strategic Outlook

The US spoonables market shows strong fundamentals with high CSF across all brands, indicating customer loyalty and pricing power. However, the rise of private label as a formidable competitor with high loyalty and positive momentum represents a structural shift. Brands must differentiate beyond price - through premiumization (Hellmann's), specialty positioning (McCormick Aioli), or value-with-quality (private label's success model).

Kraft and Miracle Whip face existential threats requiring immediate strategic intervention. The window for turnaround is narrowing as share losses accelerate. Conversely, Hellmann's has opportunity to expand leadership through selective price increases and premium line development.

Walmart emerges as the critical battleground channel - largest revenue, most price-inelastic, and where private label is strongest. Success in walmart will determine overall market leadership.
