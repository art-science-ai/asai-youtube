## Notes on Structure

**Pattern 1 (Brand-only):** ~15-20 slides
- Executive Summary
- Market Context (brand-level)
- CSF & MCV Analysis (brand-level)
- RPI Curves (brand-level)
- Trends (brand-level)

**Pattern 2 (Brand+PPG):** ~15-20 slides
- Executive Summary (includes PPG subsection)
- Market Context (inline PPG in brand tables)
- CSF & MCV Analysis (brand-level)
- Trends (brand-level with PPG insights)
- PPG sections are integrated, not fully separate

**Pattern 3 (Brand+Variant or Brand+Variant+PPG):** ~30-40 slides
- Executive Summary (overview)
- Per-channel structure:
  - Variant × Brand Market Context
  - Variant-level CSF Analysis
  - Variant-level RPI Curves
  - **Then separate PPG section:**
    - PPG Level Market Context
    - PPG-Level CSF Analysis
    - PPG-Level Recommendations

**Key principle:** Each granularity level gets its own analytical section with Market Context → CSF Analysis → Recommendations flow.
