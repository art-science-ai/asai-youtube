      msp_insight: Brand is losing market share, indicates competitive pressure or
        declining customer preference

        brands, competitive pressure is higher
      competitive_position: 'CSF lower than key competitors (heinz: -0.19, hellmanns:

      # NON-DETERMINISTIC FIELD - Enhanced by Claude:
      overall_assessment: Small niche brand losing share despite high CSF. CSF lower than all major competitors indicates limited differentiation. With moderately elastic demand, avoid price increases. Focus on marketing differentiation or consider promotional investment to stabilize share position.

      # NON-DETERMINISTIC FIELD - Enhanced by Claude:
      overall_assessment: Dominant market leader (51% share) with strong pricing power in Iceland. High CSF (2.32) combined with less elastic demand (-3.79) and positive momentum (MSP +0.0015) creates excellent pricing opportunity. Can consider 5-7% price increase with minimal volume risk. Note CSF slightly lower than Nandos (-0.17) but market position is secure.

      # NON-DETERMINISTIC FIELD - Enhanced by Claude:
      overall_assessment: Strong #2 player with CSF parity to Heinz (both 2.32) and stable share. Less elastic demand supports pricing power. Opportunity for 3-5% price increase to improve margins while maintaining position. Monitor competitive response from Heinz given similar CSF positioning.

      # NON-DETERMINISTIC FIELD - Enhanced by Claude:
      overall_assessment: Premium brand with highest CSF (2.49) in channel and gaining share (+0.005 MSP). Exceptional pricing power with very low elasticity (-3.35). Successfully operating at premium price point (£7.54 vs category average ~£5). Continue premium positioning and consider moderate price increase (3-5%) to capitalize on strong brand equity and growth momentum.

      overall_assessment: Aggregate of smaller brands with stable 8% share. High CSF (2.29) and less elastic demand indicate collective pricing power. Stable MSP suggests equilibrium. Individual brand strategies within this aggregate should focus on differentiation to avoid commoditization.

      overall_assessment: Declining brand losing significant share (-0.0046 MSP). CSF lower than major competitors (Heinz, Hellmanns, Nandos) with moderately elastic demand limits pricing flexibility. Avoid price increases. Focus on promotional support and value messaging to stabilize share. Consider product innovation or repositioning to improve CSF relative to competition.

Positive MSP indicates strategy is working. Exercise caution with pricing - consider hold or modest 1-2% increase maximum. Focus on promotional efficiency and value communication to maintain share gains without triggering elastic response.
