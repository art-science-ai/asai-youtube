# Post: Use vibe coding to validate that you're building the right thing before you spend resources building it the right way


People argue vibe coding is useless because you’ll eventually need "real engineering" to ship it to production. This is true, but it's also missing the point of vibe-coding. Vibe coding lets you test if an idea is worth pursuing before investing weeks in “real engineering".

Traditional software engineering loop:
- Come up with a new product or feature idea
- Invest "real engineering" resources to build the thing in the right way
- Test with users to get feedback

Vibe coding loop:
- Come up with a new product or feature idea
- Vibe a quick POC in days, not weeks
- Validate with customers whether this is worth


Quick POCs save huge amounts of time by validating whether you’re building the _right thing_ before you spend resources building it _the right way_





- ✅ Build fast **proof-of-concepts** to validate ideas before investing weeks of engineering.
- ✅ Create **throwaway internal tools** that solve immediate pain points.
- ❌ Don't expect vibe-coded solutions to be polished and production-ready.



The beauty of vibe coding isn’t that it makes “better code.” It’s that it gets you to _working experiments_ quickly, so you can decide whether an idea deserves real engineering effort.
