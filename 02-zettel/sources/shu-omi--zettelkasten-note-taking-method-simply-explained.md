# AI notes

## TLDR
- Zettelkasten is a knowledge management system developed by Niklas Luhmann that uses index cards to build a web of interconnected ideas.
- The method involves taking literature notes, bibliographic notes, and permanent notes to create meaningful connections between concepts.
- By focusing on retrieval rather than storage, Zettelkasten enables efficient idea generation and writing.
- The system requires writing notes in your own words to ensure deep understanding.
- Over time, it builds a personal knowledge base that facilitates creative output and argumentation.

## Key ideas
- Zettelkasten ("slip box" in German) allows building a huge web of knowledge through interconnected notes.
- Literature notes capture key information from sources in your own words, while bibliographic notes record source details.
- Permanent notes synthesize new ideas by finding connections between existing knowledge and new information.
- Keywords should be chosen based on retrieval needs, not categorization.
- Fleeting notes capture spontaneous ideas that can be developed into permanent notes.

## Detailed Summary
- Introduction to Zettelkasten: Developed by Niklas Luhmann, a prolific sociologist who published 58 books and hundreds of articles using this system.
- Core components: Two boxes - one for bibliographic notes, one for permanent notes; uses index cards and pen.
- Step 1 - Literature notes: While reading, write brief notes in your own words on index cards about information you want to remember.
- Step 2 - Bibliographic notes: After finishing a source, record reference details and brief content summary on one side of a card.
- Step 3 - Permanent notes: Review previous notes, find connections to existing knowledge, and create new notes that add value to your thinking.
- Finding connections: Ask how new ideas relate to what you already know, what they mean for other concepts, and how they can explain other things.
- Keyword assignment: Choose keywords based on when you'd want to rediscover the note, not for categorization.
- Linking notes: Place new permanent notes behind relevant existing notes, add links, and index for easy discovery.
- Fleeting notes: Capture spontaneous ideas in a notebook, review within days, and develop into permanent notes if valuable.
- Writing process: Once you have a knowledge web, identify gaps, read more, then reassemble notes into coherent writing without starting from scratch.

### Key quotes
- "The more web of knowledge you develop it's easier to learn and retrieve the information from your brain this is because the more information means more hooks we can use to connect a new information to and more connected to information also means more cues we can use to trigger the right memory"
- "Finding keyword is not about where to store a note but about how to retrieve it when deciding a keyword many people ask which keyword is most fitting or which category does this node 14th rather you should ask yourself in which circumstances would I want to stumble upon this note even if I forget about it"
- "This means you don't have to start from scratch by writing all you have to do now is to reassemble your notes into a logical order and translate them into something coherent"

Zettelkasten method is a powerful knowledge management system, developed by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist. His system allowed him to build a huge web of knowledge, learn and retrieve information with ease and develop new ideas, discussions and arguments efficiently. Not many people know about this method, so I thought I'd make a video explaining a general workflow of Zettelkasten. Hope this helped! 

In the next video, I'll talk about how I implement Zettelkasten in Roam Research!

hello my name is she in this video I
want to talk about Seto custom method
which is one of my favorite personal
knowledge management systems so total
custom method is one was a most
effective knowledge management methods
but it's not known by many people the
word
Seto custom means box of cars in German
this method was developed by Nicholas
Newman a German sociologist he may not
be super famous but what makes him stand
out from the crowd is not just the fact
he was an exceptional scholar but also
she's writing efficiency in 30 years he
published 58 books and hundreds of
articles how did he manage to write so
much it's thanks to his unique knowledge
management system set up custom saddle
Goslin allowed him to build huge web of
knowledge retrieved the right memory
when needed find meaningful connections
among topics and develop his ideas
arguments and discussions efficiently
the process of a set of custom is simple
all you need is small boxes index cars
and a pen lumen had two boxes one for
people graphical notes with the
reference details and brief notes about
content of the literature and the main
box were he collected and created new
ideas and the insights the first step or
movements that Augustine is taking
literature notes were you reading the
book or article always have a pen and
index card with you and when you find an
information you don't want to forget or
think you might use in your writing or
thinking write it down in your index
card instead of highlighting or
underlining but you have to be careful
that it has to be brief to make it easy
to review later and you have to write it
in your own words this means no copy and
pasting writing young words may take a
while he forces you to really understand
what they mean the second step is taken
be with a graphical notes whenever you
finish reading something looma wrote
tons of reference information on one
side of an index card and a brief note
about content on the other side then he
kept cars into bibliographical books
with the literature notes the third step
probably the most important step is
making permanent notes go through each
note you made into previous step while
thinking about how they relate to while
you are learning your interest thinking
or research your goal is not to collect
as many notes as possible but to add new
values to your existing ideas argument
and discussions what's important here is
finding meaningful connections between
why you just learned and why you already
know it by doing so you build a wealth
of knowledge the more web of know that
you develop it's easier if it comes to
learn and retrieve the information from
your brain this is because the more
information means more hooks we can use
to connect a new information to and more
connected to information also means more
cues we can use to trigger the right
memory to find such connections
efficiently ask yourself how does this
idea fit into what I know can just be
explained by something else what does X
mean for Y how can I use this idea to
explain something else additionally it's
important to find keywords in your notes
to find connections among nodes but
finding keyword is not about where to
store a note but about how to retrieve
it when deciding a keyword
many people ask which keyword is most
fitting or which category does this node
14th rather you should ask yourself in
which circumstances would I want to
stumble upon this note even if I forget
about it
or when and how we are use this idea to
us should always be assigned with an eye
towards topic you're working on or
interesting never by looking at a note
in isolation after finding connections I
do new primary's notes to the main box
by fighting each one behind relevant
notes adding links to relevant notes and
indexing in the way you can easily
discover later why extra step you might
need is taking fleeting notes they are
temporarily holders or your ideas and
thoughts that pop into your mind like
ideas you get wire taking shower or walk
always keep a notebook or piece of paper
with you so you can write anytime you
should review your fleeting notes within
a few days before you forget what you
meant and you can develop them into
permanent notes if necessary after
repeating those steps for a while you
will have developed a huge available
knowledge now whenever you need to find
a topic to write well turn to your box
of cards and see the lines of the cars
you developed see what it's missing see
what questions arise you can then read
more and take notes to develop your
ideas and arguments farther when you are
done with this process you will already
have a wealth of information in your
hands
this means you don't have to start from
scratch by writing all you have to do
now is to reassemble your notes into a
logical order and translate them into
something coherent so it is a general
workflow table set up
in the next video I'll show you how to
digitally implement this system using
room thanks for watching and I've seen
