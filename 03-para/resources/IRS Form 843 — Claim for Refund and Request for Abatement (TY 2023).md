**8. Explanation (attach more pages if needed):**

> I request **First-Time Abatement (FTA)** of the **6651(a)(1)** and **6651(a)(2)** penalties for **Tax Year 2023**. I had **no penalties in the prior three years** and I am now fully compliant (all required returns filed and balance paid/arranged).
> 
> If FTA cannot be applied, I request abatement for **reasonable cause**. My wage withholding for 2023 was set too low and I believed no balance would be due. Upon discovering the issue in 2025, I **immediately filed and paid**, submitted an updated **Form W-4** to correct withholding, and calendared future deadlines (and estimated payments if needed) to prevent recurrence. There was no intent to delay; I acted in good faith once aware. Please abate the timeliness penalties and **refund interest attributable to the abated penalties**.
