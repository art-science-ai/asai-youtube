## Current schedule: W1-2
- Schedule is based on a 3-hour cycle, aligned with the feed schedule.
- Routine for every feed: Change diaper -> feed -> burp -> change diaper again.
- If a specific activity is specified for a block (e.g., bathtime), that should be done. Otherwise, the time between feeds is for the baby to nap or for playtime.

## Formula feeding
- Quantity
	- Recommended = weight_in_lbs * 2.5 oz per day
		- 7 lbs = 17.5 oz per day = ~2 oz per feed @ 8 feeds per day
		- 10 lbs = 25 oz per day = ~3 oz per feed @ 8 feeds per day 
	- Max per day = 32 oz = 32 scoops  = 960ml
