## Notes
### Quick capture notes
- Title: create an obsidian database of all my software
- Details: Start with a directory in the misc dir that has a defined template and obsidian bases. We should be able to filter the bases by things like "macos apps" "server software" "tools" etc. It should include all software that I'm currently using, have used in the past, and am evaluating / considering for future use. We need to think of the right metadata structure for properties. Also the content of the notes should not include generic contents from the internet, but personalized to my reflections, use cases, etc. Some things to include to start with
	- Everything specified in my current nix flake
	- Everything specified in my dotfiles - including plugins for Obsidian, Neovim, etc.
	- Everything I've starred on Github
