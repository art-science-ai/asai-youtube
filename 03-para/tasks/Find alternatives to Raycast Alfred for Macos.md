## Notes
### Quick capture notes
- Title: Find alternatives to Raycast / Alfred for Macos
- Details: Prioritize FOSS, configurability, plugins/extensions ecosystem, community support. High number of github stars is better. My use cases are launching applications, clipboard history, emoji search, screenshot tools, quitting applications, custom shell scripts, etc. I really like Raycast features, but it's not FOSS and you can't use dotfiles to sync configs - you have to use their paid cloud service
