CSF Project ReadMe Document

Comprehensive Overview of Files and Workflow

1. Introduction

This ReadMe document provides a detailed explanation of all files shared
in the Agentic AI SharePoint folder. It also covers the purpose and
usage of each file, along with an overview of the complete CSF
workflow—from raw data processing to modelling and final output
generation.

2. Project Workflow Overview

• Data collection from market research agencies (IRI, Nielsen, IMRB) or
client in-house sales data.

• Data preparation and transformation into standard format.

• Power BI dashboards are used to explore data and understand
performance across brand, pack type, variant, and PPG levels.

• Feature creation and modelling using 5 statistical methods.

• Model selection based on statistical validity and business logic.

• Scope-level CSF, MCV, MSP calculation and RPI curve generation.

• Final PPT delivery along with scenario-planning tool.

3. Description of Files in the Shared Folder

3.1 Raw Data File

The Raw Data File is received from the client or market research
agencies. It usually includes:

Time Period Information

- Weekly or monthly timestamp indicating when the sales were recorded
  (e.g., Week Ending date, Month-Year).

Market & Retailer Information

- Details about the market geography, retailer names, channels (e.g.,
  supermarket, convenience stores).

Product Hierarchy

- Category: Main product group

- Sub-category: Smaller group within a category

- Brand: The company or label selling the product

- Variant: Different flavours or types within a brand

- Pack Type: Packaging format

- PPG (Product Pack Group): Grouping of products based on pack size

Metrics

- Sales: Total revenue generated by the product

- Volume: Total quantity of product sold.

- Volume Unit: The number of units sold

- Price: Product price

- Distribution: Availability of the product in stores

Competition Data

- Sales, volume, pricing, and distribution details of competitor brands
  in the same category

3.2 Predefined Data for EDA and Modelling

- This file is the final, fully cleaned, standardized, and model-ready
  dataset created after processing the raw data. In this stage, we
  retain only the channels, brands, pack types, and variants that fall
  within the defined project scope, and anything outside the project
  scope is grouped under RestOfCategory or Others and so on. We also
  standardize and map fields, such as converting pack sizes into common
  buckets like Small, Medium, or Large, depending on the rules given by
  the client.

- Time fields are cleaned to extract date, year, month, and week.
  Missing, Duplicate or incorrect values are corrected, imputed, or
  validated.

- This file follows a fixed column structure that remains the same for
  every CSF project, because our entire modelling pipeline is automated
  and can only run when the data is in this exact format. By keeping the
  structure consistent, it becomes easier to run EDA, build dashboards,
  create features, and execute the modelling process smoothly.

3.3 EDA

- The Power BI dashboard provides a quick, visual understanding of
  market and product performance before modeling. It helps validate
  trends, identify patterns, and highlight key insights.

- During this stage, we review the insights internally and then validate
  them with the client to ensure that what we see in the data matches
  their understanding of the market. In general, we check whether the
  trends, market share, price, and distribution are aligned with
  expectations. For example, if the dashboard shows a particular brand
  gaining market share in a specific channel, we confirm with the client
  whether this reflects actual market behavior.

- Based on this discussion, the client may request changes at this
  stage—such as modifying the project scope, removing or merging
  channels or brands, or asking for additional or different
  visualizations. This validation is typically done with business
  stakeholders such as Brand Managers, and Category Managers. Once the
  client confirms that the insights look correct, we proceed to the
  modeling phase.

3.4 Model Feature

- For the modelling stage, we first create all the required features
  from the prepared data.

- The dependent variable (Y) is what the model aims to explain. Based on
  the project input, we use either Volume (Vol) or Vol Kalman as Y. Vol
  Kalman is a smoothed version of volume that removes short-term noise
  and reflects the true demand trend.

- The independent variables (X) are a combination of price, relative
  price, distribution, competitive price, trend, and seasonality
  features. These variables capture the key market drivers influencing
  volume over time.

- Using the selected Y variable and this set of X variables, we then
  build five different modelling techniques:

- SOLS

- Ridge

- Lasso

- Bayesian Ridge

- Bayesian Lasso

3.5 Model Selection

- Using the selected Y variable and the defined set of X variables, we
  build five different models. Once all models are run, we perform model
  selection to identify the most suitable model for analysis.

- We begin by filtering out models that do not pass basic statistical
  checks. First, we check the price p-value to ensure the price effect
  is statistically significant. The price elasticity is expected to be
  negative, as an increase in price generally leads to a decrease in
  demand or volume. We also check distribution elasticity, which should
  be positive, since better availability in stores typically results in
  higher sales volume.

- From the models that pass these checks, we compare key performance
  metrics such as Adjusted R², AIC, and overall model stability. In
  addition to statistical performance, we apply business logic and
  market understanding, ensuring the model aligns with known market
  trends and makes sense for brands with meaningful market share.

- Based on this combined statistical and business evaluation, the
  best-fit model is selected for further analysis.

3.6 Result File

The level at which results are generated depends on the project scope.
Based on the client requirement, the analysis can be performed at brand
level, brand–variant level, brand–variant-pack level, or any required
combination of these levels.

Once the best-fit model is selected, we generate the model results and
outputs at the defined scope level.

Key Outputs Generated:

- MCV (Maximum Consumer Value):
  Represents the highest price that the most loyal consumers are willing
  to pay for the brand, pack, or variant within the selected scope.

- CSF (Consumer Surplus Factor):
  CSF compares how much consumers are willing to pay versus how much we
  are charging today. It is calculated as MCV divided by the current
  market price.

  CSF helps identify pricing opportunity:

- CSF > 2.3: High growth potential; price can be increased

- CSF < 1.6: Overpriced; low pricing power and risk of losing share

- CSF between 1.8–2.2: Optimal pricing based on brand equity

- MSP (Market Share Potential):
  Shows the potential change in market share at different price points
  based on consumer surplus.

- RPI (Relative Price Index) Curve & Inflection Point:
  The RPI curve illustrates how market share changes with relative price
  movements. The inflection point represents the price level where MSP
  becomes zero, helping identify the optimal price point.

These metrics are computed at the selected scope level (brand, pack,
variant, PPG, or their combinations) and form the basis for pricing
recommendations.

3.7 Presentation

- The final step of the CSF workflow is the presentation of results. All
  key outputs generated from the modelling and analysis are converted
  into a structured and easy-to-understand presentation.

- The presentation includes a clear summary of model results, CSF, MCV,
  MSP, RPI curves, inflection points, and recommended prices at the
  defined project scope (brand, pack, variant, PPG, or their
  combinations). Charts and visuals are used to clearly explain trends,
  pricing opportunities, and potential risks.

- The objective of the presentation is storytelling—to explain what the
  data is saying, why it matters, and what action is recommended.
  Insights are presented in a business-friendly manner, making them easy
  for stakeholders to interpret and use for decision-making.

- This presentation is then shared and discussed with key stakeholders
  such as Brand Managers, Category Managers, and the leadership to
  support pricing decisions and scenario discussions.

3.8 Scenario Planner

- The Scenario Planner is an interactive tool used to evaluate different
  pricing scenarios. It is divided into three sections.

- The Current section shows the brand’s present situation, including
  market share, csf and financial metrics.

- The Projected section shows what is expected to happen if current
  market conditions remain unchanged and no actions are taken.

- In the Simulated section, users can change inputs such as price and
  margin to see how these changes impact market share, volume, revenue,
  and contribution.
