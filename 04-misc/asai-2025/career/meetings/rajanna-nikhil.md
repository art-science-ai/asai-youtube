## 💡 Discussion Topics

### 1. The "Enterprise Gap" (Product Ideas)
*   **Context:** I am moving from "Big Tech Product" (Meta/Adobe) to building independent solutions.
*   **Question:** "From your vantage point at TCS, what are the biggest *unsolved* AI problems your enterprise clients are facing right now? Where are the big models (Gemini/GPT-4) failing to deliver value 'out of the box'?"
*   **Goal:** Identify niche problems that are too small for TCS to build a custom platform for, but perfect for a solopreneur's SaaS or tool.

### 2. Services as a Bridge to Product
*   **Context:** I have a runway but eventually want to monetize. You built one of the world's largest services businesses.
*   **Question:** "I'm considering a mix of high-end consulting (Strategic AI implementation) and product building. In your view, what is the *missing skill set* in the market right now that enterprises would pay a premium for from an independent expert?"
*   **Goal:** Define a high-value consulting offering to fund product development.

### 3. The Future of "Agentic AI" in Services
*   **Context:** I'm bullish on AI Agents doing knowledge work (my focus at Meta).
*   **Question:** "How is TCS thinking about 'Agentic AI'? Do you see a future where service providers deploy *digital* workers alongside human workers? How far away is that reality for your clients?"
*   **Discussion:** Share insights from the Valley/Meta; get insights from Global SI/India.

### 4. The India/Hyderabad Ecosystem
*   **Context:** You are a key leader in the Hyderabad ecosystem.
*   **Question:** "As I explore this independent path, are there specific ecosystems, communities, or incubators in India (specifically Hyderabad) that I should be plugging into? Is there an appetite for Silicon Valley-style AI product thinking here?"

### 5. Collaboration (The Podcast)
*   **Context:** I host the "Art and Science of AI" podcast to democratize AI knowledge.
*   **Ask:** "I'd love to host you on the podcast to discuss the 'State of AI in Global Enterprise.' Your perspective on how non-tech companies are adopting AI would be incredibly valuable to my audience."

## 📝 Notes for Nikhil (Self-Reflection)
*   **Be clear on the "Why":** Why leave a Lead PM role at Meta? (Answer: Speed, autonomy, building the *future* of work rather than just optimizing ads).
*   **Don't undersell the "Solo" path:** Frame it as "building high-leverage AI products" rather than "freelancing."
*   **Listen for "Pain Points":** Rajanna deals with massive scale. If he mentions "clients are struggling with X," write that down immediately. That is a potential business idea.
