About Us
--------

Cogitaas draws inspiration from one of history's most powerful declarations: _Cogito, ergo sum_ — "I think, therefore I am." We believe the same holds true for modern business: in a world defined by VUCA — volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity — the only path to certainty is rigorous, structured thought.

We are more than analysts; we are partners in inquiry. Every challenge is approached as a first-principles investigation, breaking problems down to their essence and building a logical, evidence-based case for action.

We combine the causal reasoning of economics and statistics with the predictive power of AI — not as automated shortcuts, but as tools to sharpen and deepen strategic thinking.
