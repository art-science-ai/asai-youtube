        "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our hospital due to an occasional finding during routine blood tests for monitoring your oral anticoagulant therapy. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I understand that you've been experiencing a weeklong history of fever, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had a fever up to 39 °C, and I've been having diarrhoea and vomiting for the past week.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Your medical history also includes chronic ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease with a mitral valve replacement in 2001 using a mechanical prosthesis, permanent atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, chronic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral atherosclerosis of the lower extremities, stage 0 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stage IIIb chronic kidney disease, chronic gastritis, gastric resection for perforated gastric ulcer in 1975, cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in 2009, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bacterial pneumonia four months ago. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's all correct.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. At presentation, you were febrile with a temperature of 37.5 °C, and during the physical examination, we noticed abdominal distension, diffused tenderness, and bloating. Have you passed any stool since yesterday?\nPatient: No, I haven't.\nDoctor: We performed some blood tests and confirmed a severe prolongation of your prothrombin time (22.48), with normal liver function tests. We also noticed an increase in your C reactive protein (CRP) levels at 12.54 mg/dl, normal leucocyte and neutrophil count with mild lymphopenia (860/mm3) and monocytosis (1040/mm3), and acute kidney failure with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dl. There was no sign of acidosis or increased lactic acid levels.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Your chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary congestion. The abdominal X-ray revealed small intestine loop dilation and air-fluid le",
        "subjective": "The patient, currently on oral anticoagulant therapy, presents with a weeklong history of fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. He reports a maximum temperature of 39 °C. His extensive medical history includes chronic ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease with a mitral valve replacement, permanent atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, chronic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral atherosclerosis, stage 0 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stage IIIb chronic kidney disease, chronic gastritis, a history of gastric resection and cholecystectomy, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a recent episode of bacterial pneumonia.",
        "objective": "On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 37.5 °C, exhibited abdominal distension, diffused tenderness, and bloating, and had not passed stool since the day before presentation. Blood tests showed severe prolongation of prothrombin time (22.48), normal liver function, elevated CRP (12.54 mg/dl), normal leucocyte and neutrophil count, mild lymphopenia (860/mm3), monocytosis (1040/mm3), and acute kidney failure (creatinine 1.7 mg/dl). Chest X-ray indicated mild pulmonary congestion. Abdominal X-ray and CT scan revealed small intestine loop dilation, air-fluid levels, and terminal ileum wall thickening, suggesting possible intestinal obstruction without surgical indication.",
        "assessment": "The primary assessment is non-surgical intestinal obstruction with differential diagnoses including inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal ischemia, though both are considered unlikely due to the patient's age, acute symptom onset, and specific intestinal findings. The severe prolongation of prothrombin time and elevated CRP suggest an inflammatory or infectious process, compounded by acute kidney failure.",
        "plan": "The patient will be admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine for further observation and management. The treatment plan will include monitoring vital signs, fluid and electrolyte management, and adjustment of anticoagulant therapy to address the prolonged prothrombin time. Further diagnostic evaluations will be conducted to pinpoint the exact cause of the intestinal obstruction and address the acute kidney failure. Education will be provided regarding the importance of monitoring symptoms and medication compliance.",

You've lived in Tehran city and have been experiencing some health issues. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been having?\nPatient: Yeah, since March 2017, I've suffered from periodic febrile attacks with temperatures between 39-40°C. During these fever attacks, I've had many aphthous ulcers in my mouth, swollen glands in my neck, and a sore in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: I see. How long do these fever periods typically last, and how often do they occur?\nPatient: The fever periods usually last about 7 days. After the disease goes down, the next attack comes around 45 days later. I also feel weakness, severe fatigue in my limbs, and a slight abdominal pain in the LUQ area during the time of the attacks.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. I understand you were first admitted to the hospital in July 2017 during a severe fever attack due to weakness, lethargy, and high temperature. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The doctors noticed my high fever of 39.8°C, severe aphthous mouth ulcers, inflammation in my throat, and swollen lymph nodes on my neck during the physical examination.\nDoctor: During that time, they also examined your abdomen and found splenomegaly. After these examinations, they requested some laboratory tests to determine the cause of the disease. Do you remember what tests were done?\nPatient: Yes, they did a bunch of tests, like urine culture, blood culture, stool exam, stool culture, HIV antibody, hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, peripheral blood smear, malaria, borrelia, fluorescent antinuclear antibody, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide.\nDoctor: I see. The results of all these tests were negative except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 31. Did they perform an abdominal ultrasound examination to determine the size of your ",
        "subjective": "The patient is a 19-year-old male from Tehran with a history of periodic febrile attacks since March 2017, presenting with high fevers (39-40°C), aphthous ulcers, swollen glands in the neck, and a sore throat. These episodes typically last about 7 days and recur approximately every 45 days. The patient also experiences weakness, severe fatigue, and slight abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) during these attacks. He was first hospitalized in July 2017 during a severe episode.",
        "objective": "Physical examination during past hospitalization revealed high fever (39.8°C), severe aphthous mouth ulcers, throat inflammation, swollen lymph nodes, and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests including urine and blood cultures, stool exam and culture, tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, rheumatoid factor, peripheral blood smear, malaria, borrelia, fluorescent antinuclear antibody, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were negative, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 31. An abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged spleen measuring 32 × 140 mm.",
        "assessment": "The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a periodic fever syndrome, possibly Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) or another autoinflammatory disorder, given the negative infectious and autoimmune workup and the presence of splenomegaly and elevated ESR. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of periodic fever or lymphoproliferative disorders.",
        "plan": "The management plan will include regular monitoring and follow-up appointments to track symptom progression and response to any treatments initiated. Further evaluation by a rheumatologist or a specialist in autoinflammatory diseases is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy, possibly including colchicine or other anti-inflammatory medications. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease, potential complications, and importance of compliance with follow-up visits is crucial.",

        "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see from your past medical history that you have hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and you're taking aspirin to manage these conditions. What brings you to the emergency room today?\nPatient: Hi Doctor, I've been having increasing fatigue, shortness of breath, and coffee ground stool lately. It's getting pretty concerning.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. We'll need to perform an emergency esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy to investigate these symptoms further. We found an ulcer during the procedure, so we'll manage it conservatively with Protonix and stop your aspirin for now.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for taking care of me. \n*Two months later*\nDoctor: Welcome back! How have you been feeling since your last visit?\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit better, but still not 100%.\nDoctor: Alright, let's proceed with a follow-up esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy to check on your progress. We found a single 25 mm submucosal nodule at the gastroesophageal junction 40 cm from the incisor, and it appears to extend 2 cm up into the esophagus (Fig. ). There was no Barrett esophagus or mucosal disease identified. We took a biopsy and found that it's adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a form of cancer, but we'll move forward with an endoscopic mucosal resection to remove the tumor. After the resection, we'll continue to monitor your progress.\nPatient: I'm relieved that there's a treatment plan. \n*Seven months later*\nDoctor: Good news! You have been disease-free for seven months since your resection. The biopsy showed proliferation of haphazard and angulated glands with focal crowding accompanied by desmoplastic stroma underlying squamous-columnar junctional mucosa. The endoscopic mucosal resection demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma invaded into the submucosa.\nPatient: I'm glad the resection was successful. What did the tumor look like?\nDoctor: The tumor had various levels of differentiation, from poorly-differentiated areas ",
        "subjective": "The patient, with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presented with increasing fatigue, shortness of breath, and coffee ground stool. The patient was previously on aspirin, which was stopped due to the discovery of an ulcer. The patient reported feeling slightly better but not fully recovered during a follow-up visit.",
        "objective": "Initial examination revealed an ulcer, managed with Protonix. Follow-up esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy showed a 25 mm submucosal nodule at the gastroesophageal junction, extending 2 cm up into the esophagus. Biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Post-resection biopsy indicated invasion into the submucosa with various levels of differentiation in the tumor, including poorly-differentiated areas and well-differentiated areas with eosinophilic secretion.",
        "assessment": "The primary diagnosis is adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction. Initial symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and coffee ground stool were likely related to the ulcer and subsequently the tumor. The patient has been disease-free for seven months following the endoscopic mucosal resection.",
        "plan": "The patient underwent an endoscopic mucosal resection to remove the adenocarcinoma and is currently being monitored for recurrence. The management plan includes regular follow-up endoscopies to ensure no recurrence of cancer. The patient's aspirin therapy for hypertension and hyperlipidemia was halted due to the ulcer and needs re-evaluation for cardiovascular risk management. Further consultations with oncology and gastroenterology are recommended for ongoing care and surveillance.",

Let's start by ordering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to take a closer look at your brain. \n*After the MRI scan*\nDoctor: The MRI scan showed a 10 cm left frontal tumor. We need to perform a craniotomy and resection to remove the tumor and confirm its nature.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds serious. Please go ahead with the surgery.\n*After the surgery*\nDoctor: The tumor has been removed and it was confirmed as an atypical meningioma. You will need to take 400 mg of phenytoin PO once a day to prevent any seizures postoperatively.\nPatient: Alright, I'll do that.\nDoctor: Good news is that you had no seizures after the surgery. Additionally, you received 60 Gy of adjuvant radiation therapy to the postoperative bed in 30 fractions.\nPatient: Yes, everything seemed fine until three months after the resection. I developed symptoms consistent with a generalized seizure.\nDoctor: I understand. Let's resume your daily phenytoin prophylaxis with good effect.\n*Two months later*\nPatient: I've been noticing blood in my stool lately.\nDoctor: We should run an evaluation to get a proper diagnosis.\n*After the evaluation*\nDoctor: You have been diagnosed with a locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the low rectum. We will prescribe a curative-intent dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of neoadjuvant radiation therapy along with 2000 mg PO BID of concurrent radiosensitizing capecitabine.\nPatient: Okay, I'll follow the treatment plan.\n*After 20 of the planned 28 fractions*\nPatient: I started feeling unwell, and I'm experiencing new, right-sided upper and lower limb dysfunction and an unsteady gait.\nDoctor: Let's order a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain to check for any suspicious findings.\n*After the CT scan*\nDoctor: The CT scan showed no suspicious findings. However, your phenytoin level was dramatically el",
        "subjective": "The patient reported a tonic-clonic seizure a week ago, which led to the discovery of a left frontal tumor via MRI. Post-surgical pathology confirmed it as an atypical meningioma. The patient was placed on 400 mg of phenytoin daily postoperatively and received 60 Gy of adjuvant radiation therapy. Three months post-resection, the patient experienced a generalized seizure and resumed phenytoin. Recently, the patient reported blood in the stool and was diagnosed with locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the low rectum. The patient began neoadjuvant radiation therapy and concurrent radiosensitizing capecitabine but developed right-sided limb dysfunction and an unsteady gait.",

Recent symptoms led to a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the low rectum, treated with 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and 2000 mg PO BID capecitabine. A CT scan showed no new brain abnormalities. Phenytoin level was elevated at 138 µmol/L (normal range 40-80 µmol/L). Albumin level was normal at 39 g/L.",
        "assessment": "Primary diagnoses are atypical meningioma status post resection and radiation, and locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the low rectum currently undergoing treatment. Complications include elevated phenytoin levels likely due to interaction with capecitabine, leading to right-sided limb dysfunction and unsteady gait.",
        "plan": "Discontinue capecitabine and treat with charcoal. Admit for observation and temporarily discontinue phenytoin, reintroducing at 400 mg PO daily once levels normalize.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms and when they started?\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I first started feeling chills and fever about a month ago. I went to a local hospital on November 24th, and they thought it might be acute pyelonephritis. They treated me with ceftriaxone at a dosage of 2 g daily.\nDoctor: I see. Did your symptoms improve after that treatment?\nPatient: Well, two days after admission, my back pain started. They continued the antibiotics for 18 days, and my blood cultures showed Salmonella enterica. The fever went away, and they couldn't detect any more bacteria in my follow-up cultures on the 8th and 25th days after starting treatment.\nDoctor: So, you were discharged from the local hospital on December 19th, correct?\nPatient: Yes, but I still suffered from lower back pain, nausea, and vomiting. I had to go back to the hospital just 9 days after discharge.\nDoctor: When you were re-admitted to the local hospital on December 30th, did they perform any tests?\nPatient: They did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that showed L1 spondylitis. The MRI revealed whole bone marrow oedema with endplate lytic changes in the L1 body and focal marrow oedema in the upper endplate of L2 bodies. There was also mild destruction of the intervertebral disc at L1–2.\nDoctor: Those findings indicate pyogenic spondylitis (Fig. a, b, c). How did they treat you for that?\nPatient: They gave me cefazolin (1 g, 3 times a day) for 10 days to cover the possibility of a Staphylococcus aureus infection, which is a common cause of pyogenic spondylitis.\nDoctor: Did they perform any more blood cultures during that time?\nPatient: Yes, they did. The cultures yielded S. enterica again. That's when they decided to transfer me here to Chosun University Hospital.\nDoctor: I understand. We performed a bone biopsy of your L spine on January 3rd, 2018. You currently ",

Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yeah, I started noticing some distortion in my vision in my left eye, and it worried me a bit.\nDoctor: I understand. According to your records, you were diagnosed with a vitreomacular traction (VMT) with an adhesion diameter of 397 μm and a macular cyst in your left eye. Your right eye did not show any pathology at that time. You were a myopic patient, and your initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 with a foveal thickness of 335 μm.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It looks like you received an intravitreal C3F8 gas injection of 0.3 ml in your left eye about 3 weeks after the diagnosis. The VMT release occurred 173 days after the injection, with a foveal thickness of 205 μm and a consistent BCVA. No macular cyst was detectable on SD-OCT after resolution.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. My vision improved after the treatment.\nDoctor: Now, in December 2014, when you were 51 years old, it appears that you were diagnosed with a VMT with an adhesion diameter of 397 μm in your right eye. At presentation, your BCVA was 1.0, and the foveal thickness was 351 μm. Can you tell me how you felt at that time?\nPatient: I was concerned about my right eye because I had already experienced the issue with my left eye.\nDoctor: After 54 days of observation, your BCVA in the right eye decreased to 0.5. It seems that you received a 0.3-ml intravitreal C3F8 gas injection in your right eye as a treatment. Do you recall that?\nPatient: Yes, I do. I had the same treatment as I did for my left eye.\nDoctor: Three weeks after the injection, the vitreous body detached from the retina in your right eye. Subsequently, your BCVA improved to 1.0 again, and the foveal thickness was 204 μm. How has your vision been since then?\nPatient: My vision has been much better since the treatment. I'm grateful for the care I received.\nDoctor: That's great ",

I only had a cesarean section many years ago.\nDoctor: I see. It appears that you had an endoscopic examination at a previous hospital, which revealed the presence of early carcinomas in your stomach and distal esophagus. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Based on that, you were referred to our hospital for endoscopic resection. We've conducted a thorough examination and collected some laboratory data. Your serum carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin-19 fragment levels were all close to normal limits.\nPatient: Oh, that's good to hear.\nDoctor: During the endoscopic examination, we found mild granular elevated lesions with slightly depressed irregular mucosa in your distal esophagus. We also noticed a superficial elevated tumor-like lesion in the lower body of your stomach, with a diameter of about 10 mm.\nPatient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We performed an endoscopic biopsy on the gastric lesion, and it was diagnosed as a well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. As for the esophageal tumor, the biopsy showed intraepithelial tumor cells with atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: These histological findings suggest a malignant melanoma, invasive adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and Paget's disease as possible diagnoses. To further investigate, we performed immunohistochemical tests on the tumor cells.\nPatient: What were the results?\nDoctor: The tumor cells stained positive for CK7 and partially for CK20, but negative for S100 protein and HMB-47.
