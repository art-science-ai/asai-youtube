## GSD Framework Review

Project management for Claude Code - does it work?


## Why this matters

- Claude Code has no native project management
- Context resets every session
- GSD framework promises to fix this (6000+ GitHub stars)


## Test case

- Healthcare AI agent: extract patient records, generate reports
- See [product requirements](./healthcare-agent/product-requirements.md)


## Demo

- Install GSD framework
- Run planning flow
- Execute a phase
- Review results


## What works

- Structured phases and milestones
- Persistent context across sessions
- Built-in verification steps


## What doesn't

- No plan revision once created
- Assumes waterfall development
- Too many files - context rot


## Verdict

- Good concept, execution needs work
- Future videos: Opencode, custom skills, other frameworks
