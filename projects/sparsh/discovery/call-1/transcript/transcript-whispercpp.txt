 Okay so I guess we talked about that U.S. lane that there are four main
 verticals of services in sparse one is the inpatient hospice care one is home
 care one is the living will and one is outpatient consultation okay so we can
 start and with whichever one I think you are from the counseling site right
 okay and so which of these services does that connect to okay that thing is
 like somebody is the face of the organization okay
 they come to us first for the inquiry right now when I was talking about the
 inquiry okay people come with a lot of doubts some people they come they don't
 even know what it is the inquiries and actually converts will be like very
 small-service a lot of people who come just to talk to us understand people
 think that there's some active treatment is there okay there is one to know okay
 a lot of people do come and visit to us first front of this we'll try it then
 to us talk if not me my team who are in this will talk we'll understand
 depending on the situation if it's in the end of life care really the patient is
 a matter of hours or days or months so we'll ask them for the admission for the
 admission within doctor's permission so we'll again update the complete inquiry
 we have an inquiry form we fill that form take all the details and I'll go to the
 doctor over is there at the center of the time we'll explain the case to them
 and then they will tell whether it is written for admission or not okay that
 mission is alone then we put that mission process in the inquiry form and
 everything like you know the process goes okay this is for the inpatient
 that's right so inpatient mostly they still put the end of life care okay so
 then sometimes because here we don't take any cases that are under active
 treatment okay has to stop there are some cases where treatment is going on
 simultaneously for the patient pain and symptom management okay there's some
 help over there you know any kind of support some some day they want some
 good management some are very good some they need cars that run out as in
 conciliators but all those cases will put into the home care okay so there again
 the inquiry into that home care that I will decide in any other side of the issue
 and then we could take the home care and the things will be transferred to the
 home care department depending on the zones whichever zone based on the geography
 that's right okay so that team take it as a new case and tomorrow next day
 by the evening or by the next morning they'll call the answer and patients
 family they'll ask them when do they visit what to do and also they will go
 first visit if doctor is available doctor will go otherwise the team will
 visit and the staff does social worker and they will go they'll understand the
 need as a situation the doctors need is there then they will be from the doctor
 and doctor will also visit okay service will continue as long as they want if
 the situation gets really bad they will only transfer the case to the
 identification okay we continue as long as the family needs us okay sometimes
 after going there also very realize that intensity is more than the family is
 thinking something it can be really serious they are not realizing and still
 thinking of active treatment can we do that can we do there so there our team
 doctors will go explain them why is it important for the patient to just focus
 on the quality of the life now yeah all those constantly you so my social
 worker she will again you know important to me bad anything bad we do take you
 know online sessions they will visit home a lot of times I have a lot of online
 sessions for the home care patients sometimes they don't even tell to the
 patient what is happening patiently is not even aware of diagnosis so his mother
 is sick she will not taking care father doesn't know what is happening so I mean
 a family that there is one person who is taking on everything but what happens
 patient and this cause will be asking so many questions so they need to counsel
 the family also you know children who are taking care why is it important for the
 patient to know what is happening to them because if that is not there it will
 interfere with the care management of the patient the patient wants to go to a
 hospital they want to be in the activity because they don't know it what is
 happening to them why is it important for them to know that actual what is
 happening to them breaking bad news is important all those situations our team
 will work for in there so depending on that so you talked about just now the
 inpatient side and the home care side and what about outpatient also at the
 process is the same they come they come to us they are patient is not in
 hydrodar they are somewhere you know or somewhere in other parts of the city
 other parts of this day so they would have just come here for some you know
 medication so then the family will come there will be then we will put them to
 the opiate or patient so then we will connect into the nursing team they will
 give the part-time medication is to provide they have a separate book they'll
 maintain the law in that and then they'll take the medication and go okay take it
 for 10 days depending on the situation so basically these are like different
 levels of care like outpatient is the lowest level then home care is the next
 level and then patient can you tell me a little bit about like the initial
 process like before somebody comes into any of these services like when they
 first make contact like how does that work usually what are the methods by
 which they contact you is it do they send you email or do they make phone call and
 then what are the next steps that you have so usually the owner comes here 60 to 70%
 are through the whatever okay so they'll just walk in most of the things are
 walking so before they walk in they don't even make a phone call okay
 we do get phone calls yeah yeah but it is not that it has to come like that
 only but if it comes like that then but the next step is you ask them to come
 in yeah yeah so I can't ask them to just to come here and yeah but then I'll talk to
 them over the phone first I'll ask them from head to back because if they're
 asking for admission doctors have to see sometimes if that situation is out of
 the city somewhere far we don't consider video calls I'll ask them doctors will
 see the patient so you have to make some appointment for that or they just call
 you yeah because my style of working is I'll be responding very quickly I don't
 believe in keeping things and you're like the first point of contact
 so the social concert and the psychological scheme as a whole is the
 first okay as madam rightly they are the patient's voice okay okay and then so
 just to summarize madam thing so you ask the question how do we get to the
 what are the mechanism of getting the advice yeah what are the routes yeah so
 call your mind maybe second word of mouth which is they do just walking yeah even
 before walking look at this call and ask hey what is the Google yeah address
 bring the patients don't think like that right and if somebody males you I guess
 you would just tell them to call yeah okay as I said because if they are
 from outside I personally call them and talk to them if they're from
 mother but I'll say it's possible for you to come over come down and talk to us I prefer in between the person and talking to them
 they're more rigid that you have to let if you go to some healthcare institute they will say your appointment is at that time
 so we say across if somebody comes when can we come so we are not that
 because we have a volume is also not that much yeah we don't get like 60-17
 what is the point at which you start like writing down some notes about some
 individuals in the first phone call because I believe in minted in
 recorded doesn't matter whether they are case or not because in my record I
 also write these are not our cases I have diverted them to somewhere else you
 know they have some would be an activations like we didn't we have okay so
 I have some would be an active treatment they just come like you know because the
 medication is very expensive for us can you give us a key more notes okay those
 also I have complete regard of each and every person who visits me and how do you
 make these records in the notebook I have a notebook okay okay go ahead so then
 first like a patient contacts you as the initial point of contact you talk to
 them and then you make a record of it you have a notebook and then suppose like
 the next step is like let's say they want to become a home care patient right
 then what happens is the next is is there some point at which we create like a
 formal record of this patient yeah so first initially I noted in my regard if
 it is going to convert it into a home care idea and then we have an inquiry
 from the second thing and then the inquiry from this is a paper this is not
 visited okay yeah the three assessment is before the the initial conversation
 but then when the conversation is okay at that time it's a time I make my notes
 okay I mean I can have something for people so I something called what
 the first events so this is a software where we have
 patient okay anything related to patient they're dying and when we
 registered the patients initial recording there and then we convert them or we
 add them register them into our verticals as for them so I guess there's two
 outcomes right she's saying sometimes the patient calls and then you determine
 that hey this is not the right fit then you don't register them that you just
 have in your notebook but then you forward them to home care or
 patient yeah yeah I mean what is this previous assessment form you mentioned
 or I just that you know okay but at what stage is that before the team ends
 yeah okay and you asked the
 patient to fill this no oh you feel it okay and then what do you do with this
 and then what do you do with this right it's like a three
 arch almost yeah but currently you're not like digitizing you use them to
 determine what is the next step and then file it in your
 I mean that's the kind of things I'm just trying to understand what is the
 current process yeah what is the fourth one
 you know hospital if I have to visit hospital okay that means they're not
 coming here it's like you sent them the third okay
 God so these two we'll go to okay
 so how do you populate this piece and record you do it yourself or you call
 call them and ask them for suppose let's say it's a home care patient yeah
 yeah suppose the next step would be once this come form that it is in patient
 maybe let's take the example of home care yeah in what group we have home
 here and all teams are okay okay so you guys have like a WhatsApp
 where you communicate after that I would be going to feed us yeah I have my idea
 I'll go there then I will be called you know whatever I was spoken so the doctors
 when they talk to them yeah right so whatever the social or medical information
 basic medical emergency type was what was the treatments they have taken till now what is the condition now and the family background you know
 children what are they doing all the information I love everything that we
 say okay yeah do you know like on average if you were to guess like how much time it
 takes you to let fill in this events yeah but the entire process might take
 treatment with parents because first I'll be talking to them making mine over
 so then you know the same time will come then if you send I feel that I'll go to
 doctor get a permission after the permission then I'll be going to the
 events and then I'll be entering there also okay okay
 yeah so you just like referred to whatever notes you wrote down and yeah
 because I guess like one of the technologies that is becoming popular
 these days is using AI to automatically like so for example if like if I was
 having a consultation with you and we had a recording for this like at the end
 of the conversation it could automatically give you the P lens form and
 populate it and do you know what is like approximately the volume of like
 these conversations you have per day or per month yeah
 they just need to understand whether they take taking the case or not 40 minutes for
 the conversation and then after that 40 minutes you spend maybe 10 minutes
 writing this thing and putting it in the yeah and like on average like how many
 intakes do we have daily or month or is sometimes maximum 10 okay
 including one constant we have 10 yes okay so maybe you have like a two is 300
 per month yes okay yeah okay more than that so some cases
 there we don't write anything let's just come and talk to us and a lot of
 people do visit so yeah I guess the important stages when they get
 converted is when you have to make the actual record before that is just for
 your own reference like so then what happens next suppose let's take the
 example of home care right so you have this initial conversation then you
 determine that they're home care patient and then you created this event record
 so after my own work with them under that area we see a message for a man
 okay in an official
 so from that we we call them okay
 and we buy there's a business okay some patients may not require immediate
 response okay but some patients may need immediate response okay
 depending on their symptoms it means like same day so can you see me call them
 you have to tell them and like how do you know which one means the immediate
 depends on their symptoms yeah some patients are being many but how will you
 know that like you will read yeah we very balanced out okay then we call
 the patients okay sorry when you say you read ma'am's notes there's the
 TV is known so or something else yes okay this one okay wait but how do you read
 it like if it's okay so I happens is that once I will tell because assessing
 part there's a right question we don't know actually until you go there right
 so yeah that's actually there is some kind of confusion even we are facing
 we need some help over there so some people say that emergency for me may not
 be emergency for you right watching my loved one in pain I might be thinking
 that oh we need it immediately right but what happens is that that may not be
 emergency medical emergency it may not be so right so I would be how a team can
 go visit there may be doctor may not be there nuts can go we understand
 sometimes it can be just a panic of the family okay so that's what happens so
 after that they'll assess situation because doctors receive arthritis based
 on the consciousness so what is the tell you what happens between when you have
 the intake and the first contact they have with the doctor yeah so what happens as
 as like you know providing that's over there then I will forward it to you yeah
 so it is an unofficial group is called in special yeah they'll be posted we have
 two home case groups there three zones are divided there oh we'll put it there suppose is the inquiry has come to the new city
 so then what happened he will alert that new city social worker also look you have a
 new you know visit here so they will be noted they will not have to really have a
 new visit inquiry has come yeah so my effort would be understood they'll find
 what is called them by evening okay next time morning okay they'll understand
 that our inquiry has been registered people have yeah so they'll call understand
 sometimes what happened patient will be still in the hospital okay they won't
 have got this stuff so they'll make sure that patient is in the hospital they'll
 ask them at what time do you want to come what is the condition is a patient is
 real pain what is the situation or the bloods whoever calls she'll assess the
 whole situation okay sometimes it will be as he said it'll be anywhere just like
 you know patient will be screaming in pain symptoms are there but then they
 will be prioritized every new visit would be prioritized with a doctor should be
 there or not that is a call that they'll take oh so worry the options either
 doctor is there for the visit or a nurse is there all the doctors we have
 two doctors but we have six zones out there okay so that is the reason where
 we have to divide and segregate to which zone at least every new visit we try to
 make sure that doctor is there okay again depending on the priority some because
 just know I got an inquiry I told you this is the doctor because the patient needs
 some help in terms of part but it sounds like you don't have any like formal
 system for doing this prioritization like it's kind of ad hoc like based on
 your understanding you'll make a judgment okay God doctor also keeps asking
 them every day to which zone I have to go which I have a problem that should not
 be there that there should be some system where maybe at the beginning of
 the day you can make a schedule exactly and each doctor and each like team will
 know this this these are the symptoms where I will be in the inquiry I'll be
 posting for this phone care these are the symptoms so that would automatically come
 with the program priority if I put a certain symptoms that is no longer a
 priority that by default you should know but before doctor should go and then you
 know this session and sometimes might be there be something but I think the
 problem is that like you are not able to make this assessment you need like a
 nurse or doctor to make this assessment and so either like they to probably like
 once you have a call with them the next step should be that the nurse or doctor
 has a call like a criteria and you can include it in
 your own process yeah yes yes so doctor has to do as a criteria okay yeah
 yeah ten visit a high priority ok okay so there's some way in which add hot you
 determine the priority and then you put this new patient in your queue and maybe
 tomorrow or day after you're going to go and have a visit with them so what
 happens in that first so in that first visit maybe it's only a nurse and social
 worker or maybe there's also a doctor okay and what do you guys do so I think
 maybe let me clarify like which part of this I'm more interested like like what
 software can help with software cannot help with like how you provide care to
 the patient so that part I think maybe I'm less interested in like exactly what
 care me for what software can help with is like how to manage the flow of
 information from one like you guys have so many different teams like how to make
 sure there's a proper record of information and what is the flow of
 information from one place to the next and making sure that you have the right
 like structure for that so that's mostly what I'm trying to understand
 right or if it could even be integrated into your event system or like
 something yeah okay so then you guys go and make the home visit right so then
 do you do any kind of like intake there or you're trying to collect more
 information okay
 so how do they do it do they first write it in a notebook and then come back to
 the office and enter it in the pee man or do they have it because sometimes what
 the problem that is not possible they're making a note in the notes
 one simple solution I don't know if it will be feasible or not like I said
 earlier these days there's software that if you just like on your phone if you
 can press the record button in this conversation then once you come back we
 can automatically give you like that entire notes and then also we can try to
 format it in whichever way it's helpful to you can say that here these are the
 main sections and the main points and summary and stuff so but so right now it's
 pretty ad hoc right this imperfect so maybe when they're there typically do
 they like take some notebook or like how does it work so this defense has like
 a phone app but maybe it's not very user friendly to I'm also not everyone can
 type so fast like like even for me right I was like I need to collect some
 information and if I had to talk to you on simultaneously and type this out
 with it it is a my department how it goes is 99% it is after the visit
 oh that's what is happening so it's fresh in your mind like yeah because
 there may not be possible to sit and write the phone thing so there's people
 somewhere yeah and they go back home in the evening and then they fill the notes
 okay that's what they are doing now says because there they have to take some
 pictures of the files and all documents they need there so I think mostly either
 so they have the past medical records of the patient they take photos of that
 okay and then they also asked some questions and then they upload these
 photos onto this event system and whatever they remember from the notes
 they write that also in the end of the event system okay and do they enter the
 details of what all what other kinds of care do you provide other than just
 giving medications just counseling okay I know I'm getting like a medical
 everything I'm assuming record of that also so you know like all the activities
 that yes okay so then like suppose you are going to a home care patient and
 you want to know about their history right how do you do that you open like
 the events application but is it always the same person goes to the same
 home care so but suppose like on one day you know the they're like absent like
 from work so some new person is going then how would they yeah okay but even
 if it's the same thing like sometimes you might not exactly remember the history
 of all the patients so they might check that
 yes okay so basically when we have any visit or consultation patient first the
 doctor will see the existing record and look at what is the history and then
 whatever happens today they will update it in that record okay and then is there
 anything that happens between the visits that are there any phone or video
 discussions sometimes they can ask for other requirements also like but they
 want to be part they're not a mattress with you the beaches also anything in other
 health also we provide them okay and so social counselors stuff its own number
 you shared with the family what is the zone number whatever the home care team
 contact number the phone number you wish them to them so they will be in touch
 sometimes there is an emergency they keep calling them but by default but
 weekly months depending on the parity or once in 10 days our team do visit okay
 sometimes if there is more emergency they can call them you know after two
 days three days anything over the phone the doctor is there doctor will
 just change this medication they call and the doctor says okay you can
 change this medication do they again go and update the record yes yes because
 the medication is very important right okay so the medication probably is the
 most important thing if you make any changes to that and you have to record
 okay is there anything else important that we missed about this process I think
 right now we're trying to understand the current workflow on both sides one is
 on this patient side and also want to understand like on the fundraising and
 donor side and then like I don't think we have the capability to build some
 solution for everything but we're trying to prioritize like what are the one or
 two things that would be the most like impactful to be able to solve using
 some technology and for that like build so either it could be like build some
 extension of the existing system or like build some new system like you know
 like the ones I described for doing this stuff yeah one side what was the
 question yeah I guess that was the main point I think the last thing I just
 want to ask is like yeah you guys have any suggestions on out of this entire
 process like which of it feels like the most I don't know kind of like frustrating
 or painful team today what like you think could be like improved in this entire
 process that they do this what what is causing like the most confusion or like
 difficulty right now if anything maybe you can say like hey everything's working
 smoothly like that's also fine
 oh maybe it could have a field in the key events that says something like
 interested in donation and you can check that box and then when we do the like
 donor fundraising thing you can have a process where after three months or you
 set some period then you reach out to them because that's actually the
 category of person who probably will be most interested in donating if we
 actually make a record of that and follow-up with them
 because clearly the patients are here so they can always come back but only
 they go for the movement visit and after that they won't be much of contact so if you can have any register of that like
 oh they said they want to donate yearly so then maybe you make a call
 to follow-up but it would be great if we could record that yeah like what does
 it mean I mean the patient will pass away right you're talking about the
 family even the patient when they are with us people who are interesting for
 an example there is an afternoon like to keep in touch for future things right so
 you can reach out to that person before marketing and it holds a lot of potential
 because money is money yes whatever they can yes I think this is actually
 really important because imagine if she could automatically get a reminder
 and WhatsApp or email on the day of her brother's birthday saying hey like
 happy birthday from Spark here's a reminder that maybe I can also just look
 on them how are you doing and also yeah yeah I think maybe like what I'm hearing
 is there's maybe a disconnect between your patient side and the donor side like
 these two records are not being connected anyway actually I think that
 would be a really powerful thing it would be because the patients and their
 families and friends are the main people who will become supporters and yeah
 so I mean one thing anyway that I want to talk to you separately about is we
 need to implement like a P lens like system for the donor so that in industry is called like you know CRM customer
 relationship here we're probably like donor relationship and so what I was
 thinking is like that might be one of the most impactful things we could do
 where so and then if we can make a link between that and then like so you can
 get new like people so yeah that is what I'm going to talk to you I mean I don't
 know I guess you guys want to be involved in this question yeah yeah so I'm gonna
 spend some more time with her just coming purely about the fundraising and
 donors like but this is actually a really interesting idea like because yeah you
 get a lot of people who come expressing interest maybe patients maybe inquiries
 and right now we have no way of capturing or making a record of that to follow up
 and they might forget and we might forget but you're just one person yeah yeah and
 even for you if you make a note if you don't have any reminder system but you
 can't remember all the things that it yeah
 okay well thank you most so much for spending time with me I will also let
 my dad know and we'll get back to you guys too once we figure out which one
 we can prioritize and then spend I haven't done anything yet so I feel
 bad so if I actually after all this like do something and implement it for you
 then you can thank me I'm here basically on paternity leave I had a baby two
 months ago and we're gonna be here for another a couple of months so because I
 have some time now like my dad pulled me into this and said
 a baby boy and he is two months ago so thank you so much yeah thank you
