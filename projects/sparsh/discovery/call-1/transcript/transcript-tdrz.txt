 Okay. Um so I guess we talked about that uh you explained that there are four main verticals uh of services in SPARSH One. is the inpatient hospice care, one is home care, uh one is the living will and one is outpatient consultation, right? Okay. Uh so we can start and with whichever one. I think you are um from the counseling side, right? Okay. And so which of these services does
 does that connect to? Okay, okay, got it. Okay. Okay. Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 of course we'll talk then to us, we'll talk um if if not we might include in this we'll talk we'll understand depending on the situation if it's an end of life care uh really if a patient is matter of hours or days or months so we'll ask them for the admission for the admission we need doctor's permission so we'll t again undertake the complete inquiry we have an inquiry form we'll fill that form take all the details and I'll put it to the doctor whoever, is there at the centre of the time we'll uh I'll explain the case to them and then they'll tell whether it is suitable for admission or not.
 Okay.
 vision is alone, then we put that vision process into the inquiry form, everything like you know the process goes, the patient will come. Inpatient that's, right. So inpatient mostly will stick to the end of life care only. So then sometimes uh because here we don't take any cases that are under active treatment, treatment has to stop. There are certain cases where treatment is going on, seven to eight family, needs for for the patient, pain and symptom management. They need some help over there, you know, many kind of support, some some they they want some room management, some are paid
 um uh some they need parts that run on oxygen concentrators, but all those cases will be put into the home care. So there again the enquiry will be to the home care that I will decide any resource I talk to Isher and will decide and then we'll put take it into the home care and the thing will be transferred to the home care department depending on the zones, whichever zone. So it's a yeah, okay, that's right. So that team take it as a new case and tomorrow next day or by the evening or by the next uh next morning they'll call the concerned uh patients family.
 they'll ask them when do they visit, what to do and also they will go. First visit if doctor is available, doctor will go. Otherwise the team will visit, consist of nurse, social worker and they will go they'll understand the need. As of the situation if the doctor's needs is there, then they'll inform the doctor doctor, will also visit. So that service will continue as long as they want. If the situation gets really bad, they will only transfer the case to the I_P_L_A_ that information. Your home care will continue as long as the family needs us. Sometimes
 are going there also we re we re we realise that intensity is more than the family is thinking Something. that can be really serious, they are not realising. They're still thinking of active treatment. Can we do that? Can we do that? So there our team of doctors will go explain them why is it important for the patient to just focus on the quality of the life now uh they are looking at the treatment. All the sponsoring we do. So ma our social worker, she will have again you know reported to me by anything w w we do take you know online sessions, uh we are psychologists they, do visit home.
 Yeah.
 I have a lot of online sessions, so it might be content sessions also. So to home care patients and all. Sometimes they don't even tell to the patient what is happening Patient. is not even aware of diagnosis. Suppose mother is sick, children are taking care, father doesn't know what is happening. So you kno uh a family that there is one person who is taking care of everything. But what happens patient, and this person will be asking so many questions. So then we need to uh counsel the family also, uh you know children, who are taking care. Why is it important for the patient to know what is happening to them?
 Because if that is not there, it will interfere with the care management of the patient. So patient wants to go to a hospital. They want to be in the activity because they don't know it what is happening to them. So we tell them why is it important for them to know their actual what is happening to them. Breaking band news is important. All those situations our team will go according to that. So depending on that.
 So i you talked about just now the inpatient side and the home care side and what about outpatient ones?
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 So again they'll come back.
 Okay.
 But we do counseling also yes, Yes. Counseling goes for the p it's a part and parcel of everything.
 So um basically these are like different levels of care. Like outpatient is the lowest level, then home care is the next level, and then inpatient. Um can you tell me a little bit about like the initial process like uh before somebody comes into any of these services. Like when they first make contact, like how does that work Usually? what are the methods by which they contact you? Is it do they send you email or do they make a phone call and then wh what are the next steps that you do?
 Usually whoever comes here sixty to seventy percent are through the uh what I called. The inpatientees would have told them. So they'll just walk in. Most of the things are walking, they'll come here. No no, not not required. We do get phone calls, we do get like you know by by enquirings I do get mails. But it is not that it has to come like that only. That is not a that is not a
 Today only I had one enquiry, it was from Vijay Vada. So th I can't ask them to just to come here and talk to them. But then I'll talk to them over the phone itself. First I'll ask them all from Hyderabad if it's possible for you to come and because if they're asking for admission doctors have to see the the in a divorce and all. Sometimes if that situation is out of the city somewhere far, we do consider video calls. So I'll ask the doctors we'll see the patient on the video call.
 Some appointment for that or they just call you and you know. Okay. Mm yeah.
 time. So they never require a account because my style of working is I'll be p uh responding very quickly. I don't believe in keeping things. If I leave the in-line or no.
 Yeah yeah, yeah.
 So call your mom, mail is second, word of mouth which is they will just walk in and ask even before walking look they'll just call and ask hey what is your Google address thing okay, so something like that right,
 I prefer meeting the person and talking to them all the time. Yeah I'm, sure I'm, sure.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 So we say it approx if somebody else when can we come. So no no we are not that busy because we have a volume is also not that much. We don't get like sixty seventy inquiries coming and let me get it. It's hardly ten or fifteen months so, I would say five or six months or something like that.
 Mm-hmm.
 Immediately personally called first phone call because I believe in when can be recorded doesn't matter whether they are a case or not because I am I in my record I also write these are not our cases. I have I have diverted them to somewhere else you, know. There are some would be in active patients like me and then it we have. So I'm diverted to rehab some, would be in active treatment. There are just some like you know because the medication is very expensive for us can you give us a chemo or not. So those also I have complete record of each and every person who visits me to
 And how do you make these records? Okay. Okay, got it. Uh so then first like a patient contacts you as the initial point of contact, you talk to them and then you make a record of it, you have a notebook and then suppose like the next step is like uh let's say they want to become a a home care patient right, then what happens is the next is is there some point at which we create like a formal record of this
 Yeah.
 Yeah, so first initially I denoted in my record if it is going to converted into other home care I_P_R_, okay, then we have an inquiry form, that would be the second thing. Then uh
 Quiry form this, is a paper form? Okay, yeah, I don't like that.
 Th yeah, pre-assessment form that in that we'll take. Then after that when it is converted then we have a s uh
 So with the pre-assessment is before the the initial conversation?
 At that when when the conversation is happening that time itself I make my notes, but it is getting converted into I_P_O_P_ I, mean uh O_P_R_ uh order you, know, I_P_ and have uh okay, we have something called P_V_s, so I'll P_V_S_ is a process management system, process management, P_V_S_, P_V_R_, P_V_R_, P_V_R_, P_W_E_N_S_, P_W_E_N_S_, okay. So this is a software where we have patient reports.
 Mm-hmm.
 related to patient, they are dying and so and we register the patients yes, so madam took the assessment initial recording time there, and then we convert them or we add them register them into our verticals as per the needs.
 Right, she's saying sometimes the patient calls and then you determine that hey this is not the right fit, then you don't register them that you just have in your notebook, but then if you forward them to uh h home care or inpatient then you put
 Yeah, we put them in oh, sure.
 Yeah.
 And what is this pre-assessment form you mentioned?
 I can show you about the M_P_I_ report uh M_P_I_R_ report.
 But at at what stage is that before the P_V_N_s uh yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 somehow just generally randomly they just came for like very no way connected to us, so I'll just make a note in my notebook there's also person has come, I'll make sure that I'll take their name and all yeah, this is the power cell. So this is the second step, first just one.
 Wh what do you do with these forms like you do okay.
 Mm-hmm. Okay.
 understand is that this clarifies because there are so many departments i it's a multi-disciplinary team right, doctors are there, counselors are there, there you have nurses and everybody it clarifies name that what was the need of the patient to get all go to university.
 It's like a triage almost yeah, okay, but currently you're not like digitising these, you use them to determine what is the next step and then you file it in in your reference, okay.
 Yeah, I mean that's the kind of things I'm just trying to understand like, what is the the the current process.
 Yeah.
 What is the fourth one?
 This is respite no, hospital suppose you know if I have asked them to visit hospitals, who has uh
 Okay, okay, got it.
 these two will go to uh P_V_S_.
 Okay.
 Osprey scale and uh
 So once the patient get a unbottered p events, p events is basically the software where we have the patient record. Like every round, every counseling, right, every one was like yeah.
 I do it, because ha once I have taken the inquiry, I decided that the patient has to be in P_V_S_.
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so p whenever I see an yeah nurses, or whatever doctors we got, they will do Suppose. the next step would be once it is confirmed that it is inpatient, then I'm yeah.
 In what group?
 That we have home care groups and our teams are going to visit hospitals as well, which that is the idea.
 have like a WhatsApp groups where you communicate and uh okay.
 after that I would be going to P_V_S_ you, know I, have my idea, I'll go there, then I will record you know that that ma whatever I have spoken to, so the doctors when they talk to them I, won't be talking anything medical, so whatever they're talking about or medical information basic, medical members they diagnose, what were the treatments they have taken till now, what is the condition now, and the family background you, know their, children what, are they doing, all the information I'll upload it in the P_V_S_ from my side.
 social counselors are allowed to register if they have the home care.
 if you were to guess like how much time it takes you to um like fill in this events uh for them.
 put mine over, so then you know the same time form will come, then if it is under I_V_I_P_ then I'll go to doctor, get the permission after the permission then I'll be going into the P_V_S_ and then uh I'll be entering there also.
 Okay.
 Thanks ten fifteen minutes for the events.
 So once you start entering on P_V_S_ but, once you start entering that part for that part in time, I'll find it in yourself.
 Mm-hmm.
 I would yeah, right, with that.
 Yeah 'cause I guess like one of the technologies that is uh becoming popular these days is using A_I_ to automatically like po so for example if um like if I was having a t consultation with you and we had a recording for this like at the end of the conversation it could automatically give you the P_ lens um uh form and populate it so it's actually one of the things uh and do you know what is like approximately the volume of like these
 you have per day or per month like, yeah. Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 So can we stay on the average forty minutes each company?
 Sometimes.
 Forty minutes for the conversation.
 complete yeah, so about it average. And then after that forty minutes you spend maybe ten minutes uh writing this thing and putting it in in the P_ lens and like uh on average like uh how many uh intakes do we have uh daily or monthly daily?
 Sometimes uh maximum ten.
 Okay.
 Maximum.
 Including all customers we have ten employees.
 Yeah so because i again some th uh some days not to death. Then I mean because we have no one on Saturdays.
 Okay. So maybe you have like up to three hundred per month of it. Okay. God. Okay.
 Yeah, the I guess the important stage is when they get converted is when you have to f make the actual record before that is just for your own reference like. So then what happens next suppose, let's take the example of a home care right, So you have this initial conversation then, you uh determine that they're a home care patient and then you created this events record, like that.
 This is the uh matter whatever told, that was a service part service, part when I say what we do with the patient right, But there are so many logistical part which is related to that like you know uh why don't I explain once Ma'am gives you that this is a home care inquiry that you do.
 So uh from that we we call them, we call them and uh we prioritize the visits. Some patients may not require uh immediate uh response, but some patients may need immediate response. According their symptoms no, n other day. So nurse or counselor will call them.
 So when you say we call them uh you have to tell who calls them.
 And like how do you know which one needs the immediate uh yeah. Right. But how will you know that? Like you will read the R_C_D_s. Okay.
 So or something else.
 Yes, even stuffs. Not not in the uh inquiry functions. In this one. Oh okay. Wait, but how do you read it? Like if it's a p you know, some division. So what happens is that once I will tell, because assessing part is a right question, we don't know actually until we go there, right. So yeah, tha that's actually the there is some kind of confusion even we are facing. We need some help over there. So some people say that emergency for me may not be
 Right.
 b watching my loved one in pain I ma I might be thinking that oh we need it immediately. But what happens is that that may not be emergency, medical emergency it may not be. So right way would be if our team can go visit there, maybe doctor may not be there, nurse can go, we understand sometimes it can be just a panic of the family. So that's what happens. So after that they will assess situation because doctor's visits are prioritized based on the assessments.
 What is the tell me what happens between when you have the intake and the first contact they have with the doctor.
 Yeah. So what happens as as like you know my, my team gets over there, then I'll forward it to him. So uh it is an unofficial group, that's for teams first, I think it's you there. Then we'll post it we, have two home care groups where three three zones are divided there. So we'll put it there. Suppose that the inquiry has come to the new city. So that what happen he will alert that new city g uh uh social worker at zone one and look you, have a new b uh you know visit here. He'll do that.
 they will be noted uh they they'll note that to uh today they have a new visit inquiry has come. So my effort would be I always tell them try to at least call them by evening or by next day morning. At least they'll understand that our inquiry has been reduced and people have called. So they'll call and understand. Sometimes what happened patient would be still in the hospital and they won't have got this stuff. So they'll make sure that patient is in the hospital, they'll ask them at what time do you want to come, what is the condition, is the patient is the real pain, what is the situation or that that's whoever calls she
 will assess the whole situation. Sometimes it will be as he said it will be anywhere you have images like you know patient will be screaming in pain, all the symptoms are there. So then they immediately prioritise every new new visit would be prioritised, primarily for whether a doctor should be there or not, that is a call that they will take.
 So what are the options, either doctor is there for the visit or a nurse is there?
 Nurse and social worker by default will be there all the visits. Doctors we have two doctors, but we have six zones out there. So that is the reason where we have to divide and segregate to which zone. At least every new visit will try to make sure that doctor is there, again depending on the priority. Some because just know I've got an inquiry, I told you there's no need for the doctor to go there, because the patient needs some kind of uh you know help in terms of parking or not, or just not.
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, of course.
 ad hoc, like based on your understanding you will make a judgement. Okay, got it.
 These these these are the symptoms where I'll be in the inquiry, I'll be posting about these phone care, these are the sim symptoms. So that would automatically come with the pr uh priority. If I put under certain symptoms that is no longer a priority, that by default he should know, by default doctor should know. And then you know discussion, and that sometimes might be there be something.
 problem is that like you are not able to make this assessment, you need like a nurse or doctor to make this assessment, and so either like they need to probably like once you have a call with them the next step should be that the nurse or doctor has a call to mm-hmm.
 Exactly, exactly. So because I I'm not a medical person, uh for for me when I listen to them, for me everything might look like an emergency. So doctor has to give us a criteria, okay so, all these things are matching to this criteria because, I don't know about that. In parents also in the inquiry also there there should be a sp column where okay this is a priority visit, not a student visit. So that system is not there yet. I think that framework is something which we have to work on, we need to work on.
 ad hoc you determine the priority and then you put this new patient in your queue and maybe tomorrow or a day after you're gonna go and have a a visit with them. So uh what happens in that first wi so in that first visit maybe it's only a nurse and social worker or maybe there's also a doctor there. Okay. And what do you guys do so I think maybe let me clarify like which part of this I'm more interested in like uh like what software can and can't
 but software cannot help with like how you provide care to the patient with So. that part I think maybe I'm less interested in like exactly what care we provide. What software can help with is like how to manage the flow of information from one like you guys have so many different teams, like how to make sure there's a proper record of information and what is the flow of information from one place to the next and making sure that you have the right like structure for that. Uh so that's mostly what I'm trying to understand.
 suppose if this environment can be digitalised and you could make even access to not everybody, to go to her and to attend people, like you know on, the activity doctor, so try to visit them.
 Right. Or if it could even be integrated into your T_V_N_ system or like something right, Right.
 Yeah.
 a lot of intake happens there because that is where the p social worker especially have lost their actually meeting the patient. So complete medical records, you know the pictures will be taken, it will be uploaded in the P_A_V_ and the social worker takes the complete note of them, like you know talking to the family, patient may not be the condition to talk, so they should talk to the fortunate family, what are the pa patients needs, uh because it's psycho biopsychosocial coding. So a lot of things that they have, when when is their birthday, are they married, now are their siblings, you know children, what are they doing, complete record dealing out, a lot of intake happens there also.
 like um how do they do it, do they first write it in a notebook and then come back to the office and enter it in the P_M_S_ or do they carry some laptop?
 That is what they are doing it because sometimes what the problem they are facing is network issues. Something like actually they can open their uh, you know, I_C_R_S_ and do that, but if it is not possible they're making a note in the notes and they're going back home and following it.
 one simple solution I don't know if it will be feasible or not, like I said earlier, these days there's software that if you just like on your phone if you can press the record button and you have this conversation, then once you come back we can automatically give you like that entire uh note and then also we can try to format it in whichever way is helpful to you, you can say that here these are the main sections and the main points and and summary and stuff so, but uh so right now
 it's pretty ad hoc right, this infor so maybe when they are there uh typically do they like take some notebook or like ho ho ho how does it work?
 So typically it should be that they should open their pad or their phone and register on that one.
 so if this T_V_N_'s has like a phone app, then yeah, but maybe it's not very user-friendly to I mean also not everyone can type so fast like l like even for me right, I was like he I need to collect some information and if I had to talk to you and simultaneously like type this out, it is a very
 uh ninety nine percent it is after the visit. That that's what is happening. Yeah, then make a note in their book, because there there may not be possible to sit and write the whole thing, so there's people somewhere and then they go back home in evening and then they fill the notes. That's what they write. Now since because there they have to take some pictures of the files and all documents, they are doing it there, so I think mostly it either whatever they can do.
 records of the patient, they take photos of that okay, and then they also ask some questions and then uh they upload these photos onto this T_V_N_ system and whatever they remember from the notes they write that also in a to the T_V_N_ system okay,
 into the details also. Okay got, it And. do they enter the details of what all um what other kinds of uh care do you provide other than just giving medications?
 what exact activity they will get in care since the practice co do they do practice to make a new t that will change the the machine in the data washer or do they do that.
 enter the details in the parents. That's part of that.
 So then like suppose um you are going to a home care patient and you want to know about their history right, Uh how do you do that? You open like the T_V_N_'s application and come look at that or like this. But is it always the same person goes to the same home care?
 I think they most of the time the team will be the same like, those are the same things.
 they you know the they're like absent like from work like so some new person is going then, how do they under
 It'll be the same only. It was the ninety five percent unless there's something like you know the person is only you, then the same team will go there.
 But even if it is the same team like sometimes you may not exactly remember the history of all the patients you sent right, So. they might check that for okay,
 you know the I_s in the suf the Sundays and all I go back to the home care and they check my social counselors load also you, know like that right, Yeah.
 Okay. So basically when t we have any um visit or consultation with the patient first uh the doctor will see the existing record and look at like quickly what what is the history and then whatever happens today they'll update it in in that report. Okay. Um and then is there anything that happens um between the visits like are there any phone or video um discussions or
 ask for other requirements also like but they want a card they, want a mattress we, give them wheelchairs also anything uh any other help also we provide them and uh and uh so um the social counselors the p zone number will be shared with the family. Uh whatever the, home care team c contact number yeah, phone number will be shared with them. So they'll be in touch sometimes there is an emergency they keep calling them and if they are also by by default by weekly months depending on the priority or once in ten days our team do visit.
 sometimes if there is more emergency they can call them you know uh after two days, three days, anything over the phone the, doctor is uh there doctor, will guide them okay, we can just change this medication the, and the dose and all the sometimes it's a
 And the so if the if they call and the doctor says okay you, can change this medication do, they again go and update the record? Um.
 So the medication probably is the most important thing, if you make any changes to that I mean you have to get a corporate card.
 uh you need no sleep we are updating on that. Okay. Sorry I, prepared one or two p let me see if I have uh anything Is. there anything else important that we missed about this process?
 So you're trying to basically help us in creating an app that actually we will have?
 Uh mm I think right now we're trying to understand uh the current workflow on both sides. One is on this patient side, then also wanna understand like on the fundraising and donor side. And then like I don't think we have the capability to build some solution for everything, but uh we're trying to trioritize like what are the one or two things that would be um the most like impactful to be able to solve using some technology and for that like build so either it could be like
 build some extension of the existing system or like build some new system like you know so like the ones I described for doing this stuff, yeah. So I'll start with one sec what, was the question at hand?
 Yeah, I guess that was the m main point. I think the last thing I just want to ask is like yeah, if you guys have um any suggestions on out of this entire process, like which of it feels like the most um, I dunno, kind of like frustrating or painful to you today, what like you think uh could be like improved in this entire process that that you just what what is causing like the most confusion or like difficulty right now, if anything Maybe. you could say like
 everything's working smoothly like, that's also fine.
 Um difficulty in the sense um because we don't have any retard as such suppose, say uh home care people when they visit uh home, a lot of people do tell us like who would like to donate. Uh I always think that I want something on retard that you know so, if there are people with social concerns do come and call me and then we like know so-and-so person would like to donate in the future because, you kno uh right now the death would have happened they would have gone for a big event visit. So I
 want some place where you can register.
 Yeah. You sit the social call call fungus people, but whenever I tell I have a habit of writing on everything. So are th there's any record as such when everybody can go there and check. So that's just a
 Mm-hmm.
 it will be most interested in donating if we actually uh make a record of that and and follow up with them on it.
 Mm-hmm.
 like to donate. So I I got them I got their reward also.
 Oh they said they want to donate yearly mo oh so then maybe you make a call to follow up with yeah huh.
 Fishery means? Oh you mean their families. Oh Fishery. Yeah. I mean the patient will pass away right, You're talking about the family then. Right.
 there is an actor who would like to keep in touch for future things right, So let's say we are hosting some podcasts and giving you some type of education.
 We can reach out to that also right, Something like that. And it ha it holds a lot of potential because money is money. And people impressed is like they can donate hundred rupees two hundred rupees a year aren't, we? Because uh today I may be there though, so maybe they may not be. But the record should be there because, they have this kind of yeah, it's very easy. Yeah, it's there i yeah, it's there people came she said every year for price for my son's brother's birthday, I want to write I want to write
 Yeah exactly, that's right. Yeah. Maybe I can also just you know call them how you know how are you doing and also just I can be in touch. So if that automatic thing from before is there I, think the home care also I can do the here I'm taking care. But home care also I need some support there I. can do that right,
 Yes, data animals. Yeah.
 So I think maybe like uh what I'm hearing is there's maybe a disconnect between your patient's side and the donor's side. Like these two records are not being connected in any way. Actually I think that would be a really powerful thing it would be do because the patients and their families and friends are the main people who will become supporters and yeah, okay.
 Mm-hmm.
 So in tho those people are also potential donors.
 And right now you don't have any way of capturing or making a record uh like So. I mean one thing anyway that I wanted to talk to you separately about is we need to implement like a P_ thens like system for the donor side. So that in industry is called like you know C_R_M_ customer relationship in here we're probably like donor relationship management. So um what I was thinking is like that might be one of the most uh impactful things we could do where so and then if we can make a link
 Yes. Yeah.
 like so you can get new like people uh so yeah uh that is what I'm gonna talk to you about I. mean I dunno I guess do you guys want to be involved in this discussion?
 Okay yeah yeah yeah so I'm gonna spend some more time with her just talking purely about the fundraising and donor side but this is actually a really interesting idea like um because yeah you get lot of people who come expressing interests maybe, patients maybe, inquiries and right now we have no way of capturing or making a record of that to follow up and they might forget and they might forget. So okay.
 make a note from my side I'm, assuring I'm making because I can't expect the same kind of person. Yeah that's that's what I'm gonna make a note. Yeah.
 something like that.
 Okay. Well thank you both so much for for spending time with me um I will also let my dad know and we'll get back to you guys too uh once we figure out like which one we can prioritize and then spend time with. I mean I haven't done anything yet so I feel bad taking things like so if I actually after all this like do something and implement it for you then you can thank me like I'm
 you're up basically on paternity leave uh I had a baby two months ago and we're gonna be here for another a couple of months so because I have some time now like uh my dad pulled me into this and said take it in well. Uh it's a baby boy and uh he is two months old. Yeah. Yeah Thank. you.
