This week, on episode #305 of _The Drive_, Peter sits down with Joel Jamieson, is a conditioning expert who developed Morpheus to give people a smarter way to build their conditioning regimen and improve their recovery.

In this episode, Joel dives deep into the world of **heart rate variability** (HRV), explaining its scientific foundation, how it measures the balance between the **sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems**, the various methods of measurement, and how it can guide **healthier lifestyle choices** and **improved training performance**. He explores the nuances of HRV calculation, the impact of aging on HRV, and the roles of genetics, exercise, and other lifestyle factors in this process. He also covers **Morpheus**, the innovative training tool that won Peter over after his initial skepticism, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness in guiding training and optimizing fitness outcomes. 

  
They also discuss:

* Heart rate variability (HRV): evolution, science, and practical applications of HRV in athletic training
* The decline in HRV with age, and the mitigating effects of fitness and other lifestyle factors
* The impact of consistent exercise, stress, alcohol, and other lifestyle factors on HRV
* Optimizing zone 2 training with Morpheus
* Using heart rate recovery (HRR) as an indicator of athletic conditioning and the balance between aerobic and anaerobic systems
* More
