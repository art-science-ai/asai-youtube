### (But if you must do it, here are some hot summer reads)

The only thing I want to contemplate on a beach are beautiful tan bodies. Or wonder about the lives of old ones, lounging on portable folding chairs, who take a summer seriously because it could be their last. I want to look upon blue until it covers my mind completely. Engage in harmless gossip, waste hours. Remember my old loves and dream up new ones. Lie heavily, as Gainsbourg put it, under the sun _exactement_.

I understand why publishers have branded it “beach reading.” They want to reassure me that these books won’t compromise my achieved lightness of being. I can stain them with salt water, dog-ear and abuse them, lose my page in the breeze without losing the plot. This is a false promise, because the mere appearance of a book, especially a physical one, is as intrusive in this scene as an exposed skull in the idyllic pastures of Arcadia. Books are appointments to be met and demand our full presence. They cannot be ignored, at least not without some guilt. They stand sleepy in my library, waiting to possess me, holding ideas that can change me and spaces where my consciousness can merge with another’s for a sustained period of time, until it becomes a part of me. I cannot take summer reading lightly no matter how “light” it is presented to be, precisely because summertime is when we should give in to [Mephistopheles’s counsel](https://substack.com/redirect/f282e3f7-ae82-43db-959d-04439798074b?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) and be rid of all grey theory for the golden tree of actual life that springs ever green.

But because summer is loud in sound and color, it can also bring us sweet delight to sink deeply into a book for moments of mental quiet, be it as cars honk under our open windows, or as waves break to the laughter of children, or as cicadas frenzy on nights thick with heat and the scent of honeysuckle.

This season brings a rich selection of new titles written by Substack writers, including [Nellie Bowles](https://open.substack.com/users/12430253-nellie-bowles?utm%5Fsource=mentions)’s excellent[ Morning After the Revolution](https://substack.com/redirect/5f524a42-28b0-4eba-87ec-c2aaa465b748?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), [Shalom Auslander](https://open.substack.com/users/143409778-shalom-auslander?utm%5Fsource=mentions)’s hilarious memoir [Feh](https://substack.com/redirect/32b73b0c-18e8-4198-bfb8-fa053ea408fc?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), and [Nate Silver](https://open.substack.com/users/2421724-nate-silver?utm%5Fsource=mentions)’s long-anticipated[ On the Edge](https://substack.com/redirect/6febb70b-005a-4cae-a9a0-7c279692bbf7?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), which will come out in August (and, from the looks of it, there are many more books coming from [Authors Equity](https://substack.com/redirect/25e672fb-5624-435b-8feb-7ee7b755822b?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) and [beyond](https://substack.com/@hamish/note/c-57757951)). I won’t resist taking some of them with me while I pack for a vacation, even if they threaten to spoil my pledge to keep bravely to the surface.

### **Substack summer reads**

_From new summer releases available to preorder to books published earlier this year and available to buy now—here’s your guide to the Substack summer of reading._

> On the Edge is a big, weird, complicated book. The through-line is gambling and risk, but it interprets that mandate liberally. Over the past three years, I spoke with about 200 people for the project—some of the most interesting people I’ve ever met—and read roughly 100 books. I’ve really enjoyed the whole process, even the writing process. These are subjects that I was conversant in to begin with, a more natural fit than the elections beat. (I was a professional poker player in the mid-2000s before I ever built an election forecast; in fact, it was Congress’s attempt to ban online poker that sparked my interest in politics.) But there are cool things that happen when you devote this much bandwidth to a discrete project and connect different people and ideas. The book is sort of a hybrid: there’s a lot of proprietary reporting, but also deep-dive “explainers” into everything from game theory to how ChatGPT works. And there’s a participatory element: I found myself with a seat at the table for some epic poker hands, spent a year learning the ropes of becoming a serious sports bettor, and made two dozen reporting trips.

> It’s a short book, an argument really, about the way the world now works. I think of it as the opening of a discussion rather than a definitive statement. At the center of the book is a network (not an axis, alliance or bloc) of dictatorships: Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Cuba, Belarus, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, North Korea, plus a dozen-odd others who are seeking to change the international system in order to keep their regimes in power and to preserve their leaders’ wealth. They are not united ideologically. They do not meet either openly or secretly to make policy. They have many conflicts with one another.

> FEH, my newest memoir, began with my wanting to write about the rampant judgementalism and sneering contempt I was seeing all around me. It takes on God, Jesus, Paul Rudd, Nextdoor, social media, Schopenhauer, Wolf Blitzer and Yuval Noah Harari. And even with all those sacred cows, it felt bland… until I decided to slaughter a few of my personal sacred cows, too: to point out my own self-loathing, my own judgementalism, my own ugly habits of mind.

> \[From Bari Weiss:\] Before Bari and Nellie met—and fell in love, blah blah blah—in 2019, Nellie was nothing short of a media darling. She had the right ideas, she wrote the right stories, and NYT readers ate it up. 
> 
> But Nellie is a reporter. And being a reporter—a great one—forced her to confront the gap between what an increasingly zealous left claimed were its aims ... and the actual realities of their policies. 
> 
> People don’t usually change their minds. At least not on big-stakes political issues, and not when their jobs are at risk, or their social acceptance is on the line. And people certainly don’t change their minds publicly. 
> 
> Nellie did. And she chronicles that change in her new book.

> It’s a journey through deep time and ancient landscapes showing how geology can offer us all a new way of thinking about our own transitions, transformations, griefs, losses and limitations. It is about how life weathers us and makes us into new shapes. It is part travelogue of the Peak District, part therapy guide, part memoir. It is locally based but universally oriented. A regular sedimentary geology made a little bit extraordinary by attention. Full of regular human voices and ‘normal’ human experiences that we can all relate to. It draws on my years so far as an outdoor psychotherapist, and the many more behind me as an epilithic human, growing on rock.
> 
> Through it, I hope to sell you on the wonder of rocks. I hope to encourage you to honour the ‘long process’. I hope to convince you that continually weathering into form is the necessary work of a lifetime.
> 
> But you will take from it what you will, and if it ends up going unread in the TBR pile but looking pretty on your shelf with its gold-embossed ferns, then I will take that too!

> 
> But it’s been more than that. In the past, when I’ve written books, it has felt like an attempt to convince others of how I already see the world, to broadcast my existing worldview out into the literary ether. Fluke has been a different experience. Researching and writing this book has profoundly changed _how I see the world_—and altered fundamental aspects of my outlook on life. I hope that, if you read it, my words will sway your worldview, too.
