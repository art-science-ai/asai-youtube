When considering how to assess and reduce one’s risk of chronic disease, it’s often tempting to focus solely on **modifiable risk factors**. For instance, we can quit smoking, lose excess fat mass, or take medications to reduce elevated blood pressure or cholesterol levels. But when it comes to risk assessments and management strategies for **cardiovascular disease** (CVD), one non-modifiable factor should never be ignored: **lipoprotein(a)**, known more commonly as Lp(a).

As explained on the podcast by Dr. Benoit Arsenault, **elevated Lp(a)** is the single **most important** – and most prevalent – **hereditary risk factor** for CVD, yet we currently lack any simple means of addressing it **therapeutically**. Indeed, in the absence of options for reducing high Lp(a), many physicians do not even bother to test this variable. But results from a new study highlight just how critical Lp(a) is for **CVD risk assessment** – and how, despite the lack of options for modifying one’s Lp(a) levels, this metric can nevertheless have substantial implications for **risk management decisions**.
