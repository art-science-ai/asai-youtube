### _**🌎 The (geo)politics of AI**_

May saw the second AI Safety Summit, hosted in Seoul. This event brought together representatives from the US, France, UK, China, as well as the leading frontier AI labs. The summit produced [two](https://substack.com/redirect/35f2af94-86dc-4093-9d8e-c781ca677e53?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) [statements](https://substack.com/redirect/f0b43c85-cd11-4639-958a-b718a85a17e7?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) (neither signed by China) around the importance of advancing interoperable AI governance frameworks and improving safety and inclusivity. Meanwhile, the labs attending signed up to a fresh set of non-binding [Frontier AI Safety Commitments](https://substack.com/redirect/e48a941a-a513-4e3c-a168-b07adbd3882f?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), which expressed support for transparency requirements and committed them to certain steps around risk assessment and management. 

On the one hand, this kind of engagement is welcome, but on the other, much of this work feels like a replication of the much-vaunted [Bletchley Declaration](https://substack.com/redirect/73b6bed2-75c1-4b1a-be67-ef79e7f0c088?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) of November last year. Anyone involved in a start-up knows a non-binding letter of interest from a customer doesn’t mean anything - why should these non-binding commitments mean anything more? There are already signs [these companies aren’t playing ball](https://substack.com/redirect/52c5171d-0166-402b-96f0-75a79968cf4d?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI). Both the lack of any real movement and the fact that the near final text of the main statement leaked to Politico before the summit had even started makes one question how good a use of everyone’s time these set piece occasions really are…

One of the outputs of last year’s Safety Summit was the decision to commission Yoshua Bengio and a panel of scientists to produce a report on AI risks and potential mitigation. An [interim version](https://substack.com/redirect/65924762-2dd4-41f5-8529-7f99c9fe9317?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) dropped this month, listing out a range of risks (notably not extinction) and highlighting the strong disagreements between scientists on the current and future capabilities of future systems and the trajectory of development. Unsurprising.

Normally an international summit would be the leading safety item for us, but compared to recent events at OpenAI, it seemed like something of a sideshow. It’s been a challenging few weeks for the company in the public eye. Not only did a product launch go off-the-rails (more on that later), but we saw two high-profile departures. Co-founder Ilya Sustkever was the [first to (officially now) go](https://substack.com/redirect/326da474-af1f-40b9-a3d9-bbd1e893549d?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), while superalignment lead Jan Leike [jumped ship](https://substack.com/redirect/3c90d4db-8dc7-4f07-aa65-22d0cdf435d1?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) for Anthropic. A number of researchers working on safety-related questions also left the company. 

On one level, this isn’t surprising. After all, it’s hard to come back from trying to oust your co-founder. These departures combined with last year’s events reflect an increasingly irreconcilable split that’s been playing out at OpenAI. In crude terms, we saw Altman, much of the engineering team, and OpenAI’s Microsoft benefactors, pushing to go bigger and faster. Meanwhile, we had Ilya, the former board, and a number of people working on safety trying to apply the brakes. There was only so long these two sides could live under the same roof.

To add insult to injury, the departures came with two kickers. Firstly, the revelation that OpenAI attempted to [tie up its ex-staff](https://substack.com/redirect/6ef6fd14-a987-4738-b896-8475dfc9c13d?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) with unusually restrictive NDAs. Departing employees had a choice between forgoing their right to criticize their former employer in perpetuity or foregoing their vested equity. Following criticism by reporters who dug into the matter and many on X who piled on, the [company apologized](https://substack.com/redirect/2ca9e8a2-3823-4b12-b1ff-bf14ad32c04c?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) and dropped the terms. 

Secondly, former board member Helen Toner [re-emerged](https://substack.com/redirect/f4d58796-308b-4751-8e8c-87ef98fcf5bc?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) to criticize Altman and the company for a culture of secrecy, claiming that the Board had first learned of ChatGPT from X/Twitter. She also [co-wrote a piece](https://substack.com/redirect/d84c875b-8639-4ec0-8aa7-8a605a89eae6?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) with former colleague Tasha McCauley arguing that their experiences of the company highlighted the shortcomings of self-regulation. The company has announced a new [Safety and Security Committee](https://substack.com/redirect/6e7af08e-99a4-431a-a8d7-2004317264f8?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), featuring board members and outside participants to make recommendations in the next 90 days on critical safety and security decisions. 

We aren’t well-placed to adjudicate intra-OpenAI beef (nor do we have much interest in doing so), but none of the above is _that_ surprising (again). A few years ago, many of these research labs were small, obscure teams whose work was sufficiently esoteric for those on the outside that they didn’t have to grapple with questions around deployment or commercialization. Seemingly overnight, they’ve become multi-billion dollar enterprises at the center of a global power struggle at warp speed for AI supremacy and economic growth. It’s unsurprising this has now manifested as a culture shock. After all, as the current [Google AI search result kerfuffle](https://substack.com/redirect/4bbf2c49-771e-4eca-9843-6d3ac42c50cf?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) is demonstrating, even experienced incumbents can get these things wrong… Generative AI products are not a walk in the park. But at the same time, with governments and regulators everywhere watching closely, labs don’t have the luxury of time to adjust.

We’re getting a glimpse of this future in California, as the state gears up to pass the snappily named Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, or [SB-1047](https://substack.com/redirect/881e41bc-bcab-494c-9157-9aa17e374594?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI). The bill, which is the product of heavy lobbying by [the x-riskers at Center for AI Safety](https://substack.com/redirect/a58eedcb-4ddc-4bb5-9419-e5b22f396003?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) (who have previously called for models that exceed 70 on MMLU to be banned), is a textbook example of how a focus on narrowly-defined safety can be destructive for competition.

Eccentrically, the bill covers any model that _“was trained using a quantity of computing power sufficiently large that it could reasonably be expected to have similar or greater performance as an artificial intelligence model trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer of floating point operations in 2024”_. This should immediately ring alarm bells. Compute and performance are not the same thing and as Rohan Pandey of ReworkdAI has [argued](https://substack.com/redirect/a4fd846a-4461-4f9d-8a74-05c5833a7bbd?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), it could easily result in the threshold being set arbitrarily low if someone releases a suboptimally trained model. There can be good reasons for suboptimal models (e.g. Llama 3, so it could be deployed on easily available hardware) or bad ones (e.g. a big tech company deliberately inflicting low thresholds on competitors). 

Secondly, the bill poses a serious threat to open source. Despite the bill containing provisions for a new advisory council to advocate for open source, any covered model will need a remote kill switch and the ability to delete all copies and derivations. This is essentially impossible with any open source model in existence today and would require a degree of control, monitoring, and surveillance that the community would rightly find unacceptable and infeasible.

This is a good reminder that the seemingly evenly matched safety debate on X/Twitter doesn’t reflect behind-the-scenes activity. In the real world, one side has done a significantly better job at engaging and persuading policymakers. If the community doesn’t want legislation like this to become the norm, it’ll need to organize better and, as we’ve often advocated, faster.

### _**🍪 Hardware**_

The NVIDIA bandwagon shows no sign of slowing down, as the company published healthy [Q1 results](https://substack.com/redirect/d9ecf6aa-a8af-43b2-af2b-eb81e68d82c9?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), smashing already high market expectations. Quarterly revenue hit $26B, up 18% on the last quarter and 262% year-on-year, while its data center revenue jumped 427%. The company also announced an increase to its dividend and a planned 10-1 stock split. This stands in contrast to its primary rivals, [AMD](https://substack.com/redirect/0c9d6114-4037-433a-8c49-b59879729b8e?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) and [Intel](https://substack.com/redirect/bdaea059-a8a4-4440-b752-2388a88de1e9?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), who both posted underwhelming earnings in April. 

If demand for AI hardware continues in its current form (e.g. high-powered hardware, primarily via data centers), it’s hard to see NVIDIA’s rivals closing the gap. Not only does it produce the most performant hardware, none of its rivals come close to competing with its networking capabilities, which navigate the high bandwidth and low latency needed for AI workloads. As we can see from earnings, NVIDIA is struggling to meet demand, while AMD’s demand is lagging supply. Tenders also suggest that NVIDIA is likely to be the prime beneficiary of the [government GPU trade](https://substack.com/redirect/1244b231-4784-4615-a35a-0914127c1adf?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) that’s taking off. The only potential chink in the company’s armor might be around a future shift to smaller, locally-hosted models, which can draw on the kinds of cheaper hardware NVIDIA hasn’t customarily made. We have a longer take on NVIDIA’s history, the bets it has made (often against the appeal of Wall Street) and why it is so powerful [here](https://substack.com/redirect/e025b118-ba5c-4d27-ab8d-82f88677eda3?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI).

Meanwhile, the AI chip world could soon see a new entrant, in the form of SoftBank Group’s Arm. The company [has announced](https://substack.com/redirect/784bbd8b-b299-4bd4-a1d1-089e302d666b?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) that it will develop AI chips, with the first products launching in 2025\. While Arm’s IP is ubiquitous in the chips that power mobile phones, the company’s attempts to break into the AI chip world have so far disappointed. The company’s instruction set architecture is not as well-suited for the parallel processing required for AI training and inference, its software ecosystem is less mature, and it’s struggled against well-entrenched competition in the data center where GPUs are king. A specialized chip design might resolve the first issue, but the latter two will remain a formidable challenge.

There is one bright spot for Arm, however, which is the emerging ‘AI PC’ market. NVIDIA is [rumored](https://substack.com/redirect/aa6a6b41-b517-4180-810f-4eef82b5b3b2?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) to be in talks with Arm about a PC chip that pairs Arm cores with the Blackwell GPU architecture. The company has already teamed up with [Microsoft on its CoPilot+ PCs](https://substack.com/redirect/2b13790a-69b3-44e3-b44a-3d541f5bd7e6?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), the brand name the company has given to laptops optimized for AI features. These are [powered by](https://substack.com/redirect/48e048b5-475e-4ffb-ad87-23921edaa0f3?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) Qualcomm’s Arm-compatible ‘Neural Processing Units’. This market may prove better suited to Arm’s core strengths, rather than doing battle in the cloud.

### _**🏭 Big ~~tech~~ start-ups**_ 

Elon Musk’s xAI [announced](https://substack.com/redirect/5491467a-e9cf-41ad-a026-2acf412da335?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) that it had completed an eye-watering $6B Series B round, valuing the company at $24B. It’s likely that this funding round will primarily be used to pay its equally eye-watering GPU bills - the company is [said to be in discussions](https://substack.com/redirect/54576098-80a3-4d85-9979-8920b75484dd?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) with Oracle (which builds and runs GPU data centers) about a $10B cloud services deal. While the company has demonstrated an ability to roll-out high-performing models at pace with a small (crack) team (as they say), from a standing start, we’re no closer to figuring out what its long-term ambitions are. At various stages, xAI’s stated goals have been ‘maximal truth-seeking’, powering X, and preventing ‘AI dystopia’. Not only do all three of these arguably conflict, it’s not obvious that the company is trying to accomplish any of them. We await future developments with interest.

It was a big month for OpenAI, as it unveiled [GPT-4o](https://substack.com/redirect/0ab3e510-4d7b-48e9-9070-69a13475c3f8?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) (for “omni”), billed as the company’s flagship model, with the ability to reason across audio, vision, and text in real-time and with personality. The previous ChatGPT Voice Mode combined three separate models, which transcribed the audio to text, processed it, and converted the text back to audio. This lacked the ability to judge tone or expression and introduced additional latency. By contrast, GPT-4o combines all these modalities in a single end-to-end model (adding another chapter of the Bitter Lesson). This model was able to hit GPT-4 Turbo level performance for text, reasoning, and coding, while exceeding it on multilingual, audio, and vision capabilities.

Unfortunately, everyone’s collective attention was quickly sidetracked by one of the more bizarre rows of the GenAI era, as Scarlett Johansson [called out](https://substack.com/redirect/e19c62a9-18dc-4878-b8b8-211b2b410aa3?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) the company’s use of a voice that sounded _“eerily similar”_ to her own for the demo. She said that OpenAI had previously approached her to voice ChatGPT’s voice capabilities and that she had declined. OpenAI [claimed](https://substack.com/redirect/c3889635-560a-41f9-9b62-5f0a9c580d47?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) that they had cast the voice of ‘Sky’ before approaching Johansson and the [documentary record appears to back them up](https://substack.com/redirect/0fe9ee85-b983-40c4-99f5-0420ff6169e3?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI).

Putting aside the issue of whether a voice can be legally protected (in fact, prior cases in US courts ruled that a [person’s voice cannot be copyrighted](https://substack.com/redirect/5445af35-a8ad-4a6d-b3aa-61317a09978a?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)), this dispute illustrates the challenges that lie ahead for model builders. While there are some clear cut cases (e.g. Getty Image watermarks appearing on images generated by Stable Diffusion), there are plenty of more ambiguous examples (the OpenAI/New York Times [litigation](https://substack.com/redirect/46faf790-4e63-4c8b-bb34-8dd3fab81c8e?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) being a good case). It’s easy to imagine there being more and more false alarms, hence why OpenAI [seems keen](https://substack.com/redirect/4bf232d1-4412-4d99-b0d2-eb7c79e781a0?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) to head as many of its potential foes off at the pass as possible.

Meanwhile, we’ve seen a run of Gemini updates from Google DeepMind. As well as Gemini getting a strong billing at [Google I/O](https://substack.com/redirect/39eea4e9-e864-464e-b2bb-ff4e31c2e780?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI), there were some technical updates. The company unveiled Gemini 1.5 Flash, a lightweight model optimized for speed and efficiency, with impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities and a 1 million token context window.

Meanwhile, Mistral had two strokes of good fortune. Firstly, the UK Competition and Markets Authority announced that it was [dropping its investigation](https://substack.com/redirect/a3cbbe18-e267-4ade-872d-70ee9ed37451?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) into the company’s Microsoft investment … one day after formally opening it. This followed weeks of unnecessary uncertainty, likely wasted lawyers fees from Mistral, and will have consumed resources at an already stretched regulator - all for the sake of a small non-equity investment. 

Secondly, the company [hired](https://substack.com/redirect/898a5aaf-71ca-445f-aa66-a209f198e8f3?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI) its first US general manager as it prepares to expand across the Atlantic. The company is betting that enterprise customers will want cheaper, open alternatives to Google and OpenAI that don’t lock them into wider ecosystems. This will be an important test case for the ability of European foundation model providers to be taken seriously on the global stage. We wish the Mistral team luck and will be watching closely.

**[Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3](https://substack.com/redirect/d4fd8f71-9350-4bd1-aeb0-f507b7aee304?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)**, _Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs._ 

Introduces AlphaFold 3 (AF3), the latest iteration of Google DeepMind’s protein structure prediction model. Unlike its predecessors, AlphaFold 1 and 2, AF3 goes beyond protein structure prediction to predict the structures of a wider range of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and modified residues. This updated model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy over specialized tools in predicting protein-ligand, protein-nucleic acid, and antibody-antigen interactions, showcasing its potential for broad application in biological and therapeutic research.

AF3 introduces several changes to improve its predictions. It simplifies the way it processes data, reducing the need for complex sequence alignments, instead using a new Pairformer Module, which focuses on how pairs of molecules interact. Additionally, it uses a Diffusion Module that directly predicts the positions of atoms without relying on complicated geometric frames. This makes the model more flexible and able to handle various chemical structures more efficiently.

To prevent the model from generating plausible but incorrect structures, AF3 uses cross-distillation. This involves training the model with examples from a related version, AlphaFold-Multimer, which helps it learn to avoid common mistakes. AF3 also includes a method for assessing the confidence of its predictions, ensuring more reliable results.

**[The Foundation Model Transparency Index v1.1](https://substack.com/redirect/98f4da6f-c609-453c-b344-179310526064?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI),** _Stanford University._ 

Conducted in May 2024 the latest installment of the index assessed the transparency of 14 leading foundation model developers based on 100 indicators spanning ‘upstream’ factors data, labor, compute, ‘model-level’ factors around capabilities and risk, ‘downstream’ criteria around distribution, and societal impact.

Compared to the initial index from October 2023 (v1.0), average scores improved from 37 to 58 out of 100, with developers disclosing new information for an average of 16.6 indicators. However, significant gaps in transparency remain, especially regarding upstream resources like data and labor.

The index found wide variation in transparency among developers, with scores ranging from 33 to 85\. Open source model developers generally outperformed closed source developers, especially on upstream indicators. Overall, developers scored highest on user interface, model capabilities, and model basics, but struggled with data access, societal impact, and demonstrating model trustworthiness. Several subdomains like compute and usage policies saw marked improvements since v1.0\. Of the major labs, Meta scored highest at 60 (up from 54 in October) and Amazon lowest at 41 (up from 12 in October).

The report recommends that foundation model developers publish transparency reports, customers exert influence to drive transparency, and policymakers assess interventions in persistently opaque areas. We think that’s fair and will accelerate progress. 

**[MobileCLIP: Fast Image-Text Models through Multi-Modal Reinforced Training](https://substack.com/redirect/61f6d2f6-00df-410b-996d-566345b6b644?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)**, _Apple._

Introduces MobileCLIP, a new family of efficient image-text models optimized for fast inference on mobile devices, prioritizing low latency and small model size. The authors introduce a novel training approach called multi-modal reinforced training, which improves the accuracy of these compact models by transferring knowledge from an image captioning model and an ensemble of strong CLIP encoders. This additional knowledge, including synthetic captions and embeddings from the teacher models, is stored in a reinforced dataset, avoiding additional computational overhead during training.

The family includes four variants (S0, S1, S2, and B), catering to different latency and size requirements for varying mobile applications. MobileCLIP models trained on the reinforced dataset achieve state-of-the-art latency-accuracy tradeoffs for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, outperforming larger CLIP models. For example, the MobileCLIP-S2 variant is 2.3 times faster while being more accurate than the previous best CLIP model based on ViT-B/16.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their multi-modal reinforced training by applying it to a CLIP model based on the ViT-B/16 image backbone, resulting in a significant average performance improvement on 38 evaluation benchmarks compared to the previous best model. Moreover, they show that their approach achieves 10 to 1000 times better learning efficiency than non-reinforced CLIP training.

**[Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet](https://substack.com/redirect/c6231921-dd4f-47fb-9f28-ca28733474f4?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI),** _Anthropic._

Eight months ago, Anthropic's interpretability team began scaling sparse autoencoders to extract monosemantic features from their Claude 3 Sonnet model. A sparse autoencoder is a neural network used to learn efficient representations of data by emphasizing important features and ensuring only a few features are active at any time. It consists of an encoder, which maps input data to a higher-dimensional space, and a decoder, which attempts to reconstruct the original data from these sparse features. By using SAEs, the team could decompose the activations of Claude 3 Sonnet into interpretable components.

Initially, the feasibility of this approach for state-of-the-art transformers was uncertain. However, the team successfully scaled the method, extracting high-quality, interpretable features. These features were diverse and highly abstract, capable of responding to and influencing abstract behaviors. Examples included features representing famous people, locations, and type signatures in code. Some features exhibited multilingual and multimodal properties, reflecting the same concept across different languages and media.

The team found features that could have safety implications. These included features related to security vulnerabilities, biases, deception, and dangerous content such as bioweapons. Although these features indicate potential safety risks, their presence does not confirm the model's ability to execute harmful actions.

Introduces BiomedParse, a comprehensive biomedical foundation model, designed to enhance image analysis by simultaneously performing segmentation, detection, and recognition tasks for 82 object types across nine imaging modalities. Unlike traditional methods that handle these tasks separately and often require pre-specified spatial inputs like bounding boxes, BiomedParse uses joint learning to improve accuracy and efficiency, leveraging natural language prompts to identify and segment objects.
