As the concept of [autoregulation](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/6qhehou7x44ogpbo/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3Ryb25nZXJieXNjaWVuY2UuY29tL2F1dG9yZWd1bGF0aW9uLw==) has grown in popularity, so has the need for people to be accurate at estimating their repetitions in reserve (RIR). In both the gym and on social media, it is not uncommon to hear that people are either training easier or harder than they are supposed to – with some often questioning whether people are actually accurate at predicting RIR.

As a coach, I’ve seen my fair share of people greatly over- and under-estimating their RIR, something that is usually among the first things I try to address when working with a new client.

But are people really that bad at predicting RIR or is the above mostly a case of availability bias? Availability bias is the cognitive bias that leads to people overestimating the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind; something that I could totally see being the case with my own coaching experience. After all, I am likely more prone to remember the few clients I needed to work on dealing with prediction accuracy over a few weeks versus all the clients that were simply on point and did not need any prediction accuracy calibration.

Additionally, is there evidence to suggest that I, as an experienced coach, can better predict RIR by watching video footage versus the trainee who is actually performing the exercise?

Thankfully, the current literature can help us answer both questions.

When trying to understand whether individuals are able to accurately predict RIR, a scoping review and exploratory meta-analysis by [Halperin et al](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/e0hph0u0mzz4g0c8/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjEwMDcvczQwMjc5LTAyMS0wMTU1OS14) is the most comprehensive analysis of the topic. The review found that, in general, trainees are able to predict their RIR fairly accurately, with their predictions being imperfect by roughly one repetition. Interestingly, accuracy did not differ much between trained and untrained participants but it does seem like people were less accurate with their predictions during higher repetition sets (>12 reps). Similarly to the [Halperin et al](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/e0hph0u0mzz4g0c8/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjEwMDcvczQwMjc5LTAyMS0wMTU1OS14) review, a few recently published studies ([1](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/7qh7h2uodeez79fz/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zNzAzNjc5NS8=), [2](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/z2hgh7u35zzwvwcp/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zNzQzNjcyNC8=), [3](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/p8hehquzreex08uq/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zNzk2NzgzMi8=)) also found that both trained and untrained individuals are off in the predictions by roughly one repetition. In terms of coaches’ ability to accurately predict RIR by watching video footage, a recent study by [Emanuel et al](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku32xxqzotoh06evdohkhz7o4999u3/x0hph3uwkmm36ks5/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wbWMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvUE1DOTU4ODE0MC8=) found that coaches underpredicted RIR when making their predictions early in the sets, but became more accurate or slightly overpredicted by roughly one rep as the sets neared completion.

Overall, it seems like most people are fairly accurate at predicting RIR. 

However, the following practical tips may help you perfect your prediction ability:

* Assume that you may be underpredicting your RIR by one repetition.
* If you generally find it difficult to know whether you are truly close failure, try mostly doing sets below 12 repetitions.
* Actively try to predict RIR during a set, and specifically when the set is approaching the end.
* Take the last set of some exercises to failure while also predicting RIR during said set. Anecdotally, this may help you calibrate your ability to predict RIR for each exercise and allow you to appropriately select loads for subsequent sets.
