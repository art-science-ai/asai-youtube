### **Dear Friends of the [Communication Dojo](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/c2ce5c54-747e-4569-ba49-19dca3828769?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI),**

Happy Wednesday! Thank you for all the practice that we have been able to share together this Hike. We have a collection of things from the community that we would like to amplify. 

#### **CORE Skills Workshop**

Are you looking to deepen your T-group experience beyond Communication Dojo? The CORE Skills Lab is a 7-week immersive program designed for those with previous T-group experience, starting with an orientation on July 8, 2024, and continuing every Monday through August 19, 2024\.

#### **Seeking Groups in Twin Cities**

Hello all, I am a major T "groupie" who has the pleasure of participating in the Dojo from time to time. A next chapter in life is taking me to Minneapolis, MN where I hope to find similar communities to the one you all have cultivated. If you know of any T-group-esque groups or in-person practicum in the Twin Cities area, I would love to hear about them. You can reach me at **sashanewton.ca@gmail.com**. Thank you and wishing you all a summer of wonder and wellness! 

Warm regards,

Sasha

#### **A Book Written by a Member of the Community**

"How did we get to this place of feeling so stuck? How might we invest in our own enlightenment and build new structures to support the ways we want to work together? How can we stay motivated, and keep our teams motivated in systems that are failing? What can we do right now to prepare for a future we do not know?

This book is an invitation to transform how we work. This is an invitation to pause and observe what is happening around us in this time of great transition. The space between no longer and not yet. An in-between time. Check it out." [https://www.amazon.com/Between-Ann/dp/196008500X](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/897cb47c-a112-41e4-aac2-aa57541ed1c0?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)

#### **Invitation to the Sandbox**
