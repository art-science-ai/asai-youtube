As AI weaves its way into more and more products, companies are realizing they need dedicated product leaders to guide the way. Enter the rapidly evolving role of the AI Product Manager. 

**But how exactly does the AI Product Ladder change as your org climbs the career ladder?**

Let's dive in, as per image above, at the most junior level, the Associate Product Manager (APM) or Product Manager (PM) (L3/4) primarily focuses on working hand-in-hand with AI/ML eng teams to _shepherd_ the development and deployment of AI models. Key tasks include monitoring model performance, ensuring data pipelines are in place, adhering to AI governance and ethics guidelines. **The scope is tactical - making sure that AI "machinery" is integrated into an AI-powered experience,** for example owning the implementation of an AI chatbot for Zappos.

As you step up to the Senior Product Manager level (\~L5), the role broadens. Now you're not just focused on shipping AI features, but defining the holistic AI product roadmap and strategy. You'll work xfn with design, data science, and go-to-market teams to actually identify and prioritize the most impactful AI use cases to bring to life. Evangelizing the product vision to both internal and external stakeholders becomes critical. **Here, the scope expands to weaving multiple AI capabilities together into a cohesive product offering**, for example launching a personalized recommendations feature for Netflix.

Move up to the Principal Product Manager or Group Product Manager level (\~L6/7), and the responsibilities get meatier. You're setting the multi-year vision for where AI can take the product, and rallying the entire team around that north star. Securing buy-in and resources from executive leadership is part of the job. You'll also be more involved in defining the AI infrastructure and data strategy to enable cutting-edge innovation. **The scope covers the full AI lifecycle of taking major AI initiatives from concept to market success,** for example leading a discovery platform at Pfizer.

Finally, at the Product Director, VP and CPO level, the focus zooms all the way out to defining the company's overarching AI strategy and roadmap. 

* _What AI-powered products and businesses should we be betting on to secure our future?_
* _What investments, partnerships and acquisitions do we need to make that happen?_

Responsibilities span influencing board-level decisions, driving key strategic initiatives, and positioning the firm as an AI thought leader. **The ultimate scope is leveraging AI to disrupt industries and shape the company's long-term competitive advantage,** for example overseeing AI across Google’s product suite or shaping Amazon’s 10-year vision.

While the day-to-day of an AI PM may look quite different from level to level, there are common threads across the board: a passion for transformative innovation, a commitment to responsible AI practices & the ability to lead teams around an ambitious vision while keeping them motivated throughout an experimentation-first culture towards continuous iteration for long-term success.
