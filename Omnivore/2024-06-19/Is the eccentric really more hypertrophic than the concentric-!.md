When discussing resistance training, you may hear about the importance of the eccentric part of a repetition and how it may be more important than the concentric part, at least for muscle growth. From emphasizing eccentric control to performing solely eccentric training, the superiority of eccentric actions over concentric actions is often highlighted in the lifting world. 

In support of the idea that eccentric actions are more hypertrophic than concentric actions, people often cite a classic 2017 systematic review & meta-analysis by [Schoenfeld et al](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/58hvh8umq46k24f6/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8yODQ4NjMzNy8=), which highlighted that eccentric actions lead to \~3% more muscle growth than concentric actions, while also noting that the differences were not statistically significant and that both actions should ideally be included when trying to maximize hypertrophy.

Although solely performing the eccentric phase of repetition has been shown to be more hypertrophic than concentric repetitions alone, no major hypertrophic differences appear to exist when concentric and eccentric-only conditions are matched for overall workload ([Franchi et al., 2017](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/25h2h9u26qm4wxf3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wbWMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvUE1DNTQ5NTgzNC8=)). The review by [Franchi et al (2017)](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/25h2h9u26qm4wxf3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wbWMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvUE1DNTQ5NTgzNC8=) noted that the literature is not entirely clear on whether one action is better than the other for long-term muscle growth while highlighting that “when both exercises paradigms are matched for either maximum load or work, the hypertrophic responses are very similar.”

Contrastingly, a more recent study by Maeo et al ([2018](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/qvh8h8urzlkopxil/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wbWMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvUE1DNjA3MjM4NC8=)) explored the neuromuscular adaptations to work-matched maximal eccentric versus concentric training and found that even when matched for total work, eccentric training was more effective than concentric training in promoting hypertrophy. Additionally, [Sato et al (2022)](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/9qhzhdup0e5zmqs9/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zNjEwNzIzMy8=) found that when comparing three groups of untrained individuals performing either eccentric-only, concentric-only, or a combination of eccentric and concentric actions for 5 weeks, elbow flexor muscle thickness increases were similar among the eccentric-only and the concentric and eccentric groups, despite the eccentric group performing approximately half the training volume. Although the study by [Sato et al (2022)](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/9qhzhdup0e5zmqs9/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zNjEwNzIzMy8=) provides some useful insight regarding the potential benefits of eccentric-only training, the participants were untrained individuals and only trained their elbow flexors for a brief five weeks, thus warranting caution when generalizing to longer timescales.

So yes, it does indeed seem like both types of muscle actions are effective for muscle growth, although, at least in my opinion, this does not really change the current practical recommendations for the majority of trainees interested in maximizing muscle growth. As it stands, it still seems like a solid idea to include both muscle actions, especially from a practical standpoint. Although some exercises may lend themselves better to either eccentric- or concentric-only training (eg: Nordic curls vs deadlifts), including both the eccentric and concentric part for the majority of your repetitions still makes sense, especially if you’re trying to maximize hypertrophy. 

However, things seem to be relatively flexible when it comes to repetition tempo, without the need for a specific eccentric or concentric repetition tempo, as long as your overall repetition tempo is somewhere [between 2-8 seconds](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8uqm448z5hoh2l6ex3s2hx98zz66h7/3ohphdu70kp4l2hr/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zODI0OTA4Ni8=). The above aside, it’s important to note that the research on eccentric vs. concentric training further highlights that one can be extremely flexible when trying to gain muscle, especially if they are not necessarily looking to absolutely maximize adaptations (eg: when training around injury or when dealing with sedentary populations). If you find yourself needing to prioritize concentric or eccentric training at any time of your training career, worry not. It’s likely that you’re still going to continue seeing gains in muscle size!
