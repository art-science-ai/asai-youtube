Greetings,

Enrollment for this cohort into the _Early_ program is officially **open**. The period will remain open until capacity for this cohort has been reached, at which point the enrollment period will **close**.

In trying to explain _Early_ to friends and family, I’ve found it difficult to convey the magnitude of the program. We’ve quite literally mapped **the journey of a patient** in our practice and consolidated it into a digital program that anyone can complete.

_Early_ is a program of **action** designed to help you implement a plan that gives you the greatest chance to maximize the length and quality of your life.

To illustrate this point, we’ve created an **interactive outline** of what **your journey in the program** will look like. [You can access this material here](https://peterattiamd.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=21bc5f75235505c27ce465f90&id=36eeffd4d1&e=39b3f7ed50).

I hope that you’ll join us on this journey. Whether you do or not, I’d like to thank you for your continued support, listenership, and our shared commitment to a better, longer life.

\-Peter
