**You may have heard** that taking a break from your diet is a surefire way to ensure long-term fat loss by keeping your metabolism high, helping maintain muscle mass, and doing so while also reducing hunger. 

Diet breaks involve periods during a diet where one stops dieting and consumes maintenance calories, providing them with a mental and possibly physical break from the continuous calorie reduction they are following. Intuitively, that makes some sense, as one could imagine that a period of higher energy intake could potentially lead to positive physiological adaptations following prolonged periods of dieting. 

But are the above claims actually supported by the literature?

Does it really matter? After all, the mighty placebo effect is all you need to make everything work, am I right? Actually, the placebo effect is not exactly as powerful as most people think it is, but that’s a topic for another newsletter. Back to diet breaks!

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by [Poon et al (2024)](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zulk33vrnceh5ee2w2txh309x777b5/7qh7h2uodqmzmgiz/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zODE5MzM1Ny8=) looked at the effects of intermittent dieting with break periods on body composition and metabolic adaptation. The authors essentially looked at randomized control trials that compared continuous dieting to dieting that included a diet break, with a minimum duration of 4 weeks. The authors excluded studies looking at intermittent fasting and refeeds, exclusively looking at diet breaks.

12 studies with a total of 881 participants met the authors' criteria, with participants ranging from sedentary to resistance-trained individuals, and interventions lasting anywhere from 4 to 30 weeks. 

Overall, both diet breaks and continuous dieting resulted in significant reductions on bodyweight, fat, and waist circumference, with no significant changes observed for fat-free mass. However, continuously dieting resulted in a significant reduction in resting metabolic rate, something that was not observed for those incorporating diet breaks. Interestingly, this effect was observed for all types of diet breaks and interventions, with overweight individuals experiencing a greater metabolic retention of resting metabolic rate compared to those who were resistance trained. 

That said, if we look closely at the results, the metabolic rate difference between those continuously dieting and those incorporating a diet break was approximately 50 Calories per day, a difference that I doubt most people would consider as meaningful. Nonetheless, it is also worth noting that overweight and obese individuals lost substantially more weight than those who were resistance trained (\~6kg vs \~2kg), something that was also reflected in their resting metabolic rate reduction (\~73kcal vs \~10kcal). This is somewhat important to note as it may be that losing greater amounts of bodyweight results in greater reductions in resting metabolic rate – which may become meaningful after a certain point. 

**At this stage though, it does seem like diet breaks are not the diet game changer they’re often presented to be, but can still be a great way for one to take a mental break from their diet without negatively impacting their fat loss.** Additionally, diet breaks [have been shown](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zulk33vrnceh5ee2w2txh309x777b5/p8hehquzrmlx72iq/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJtZWQubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi8zMzU4NzU0OS8=) to decrease disinhibition: people lower their usual social restraints and behave more freely or impulsively, potentially helping with diet adherence. 

In terms of practical takeaways, diet breaks are just another tool in your dieting toolbox. A good way to potentially utilize them is to schedule diet breaks around specific events (like going on vacation) where you know that dieting will be more difficult than usual, either because of food availability being different or simply because you’d rather not diet while away from your usual setup. Diet breaks can help you stay “on track” while removing a lot of the stress usually associated with dieting, with the only downside being that reaching your end body composition goal will probably take a bit longer. Aside from scheduled diet breaks, the current literature also supports the notion that non-scheduled diet breaks (eating at maintenance during a high-stress week, for example) are not going to be deleterious to your long-term fat loss journey assuming you continue dieting as planned. 

Use diet breaks as needed, but don’t feel like you must incorporate them if you do not feel the need to. They’re unlikely to make a huge difference for your fat loss or metabolism!
