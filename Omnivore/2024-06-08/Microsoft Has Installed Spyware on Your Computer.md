 Welcome to edition #37 of the “No Longer a Nincompoop” with Nofil newsletter. 

 Here’s the tea 🍵 

* Microsoft spyware 🕵️
* AI governance board 🏢

## AI “productivity” has gone too far

 Microsoft has installed literal spyware on your computer. 

 No, I’m not joking. 

 Microsoft’s new tool called [Recall](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.C5G932fknKjVCc%5FagEa3BN3udWqGymbs69EryAVySl2A91U4sSUD%5FL3rMcQWKKWjw9bHf-0ClJs14DP9Q6aO1BcAwQNOpYZSBrb1jgjifzVQ9ox6RnTEJcXlFT0I5ZjaHOm991cBOEl8n6%5F04wLy1zB-dG4Sap9vmB0aZ6YlogxAUAZrFO%5FwYoqXvBpCasZhuzKhZWAshTS5Qsd9mJD1Bb7oOoJxmmPIsN2a5NEgNV1KghibxhAFRqiyCTiNuYZpK%5FiL%5Fr-8OiK1-vxm4hGwWGQwPQd5QKgcrPfTPzCdynw/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h5/h001.Fkqx051VrYQ9H-Qzzbt49rUXKnpn6mS4kmwSHRAHfYc) takes a screenshot of your computer screen every few seconds. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing; on the internet, playing a game, typing a password… It will screenshot what you’re doing. 

 If there is sensitive information on the screen at the time, will it obfuscate it? 

 No. 

 It will take screenshots of your passwords, your banking info, of absolutely anything and everything you do on your computer. Point being you can ask an AI about anything you’ve seen. 

 To actually release this as a “product” and hide it behind AI enhancement is downright ludicrous and ridiculous. This is too far. Microsoft is playing a very dangerous game here. 

 The fact that they decided to release this even after their recent hack and [data breach](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.gsh9lu3PT9xDft3dHaeCfWtWRYkkMDmXcjzsWzej84tqtnXYuCaIDyC2A8RSLmSkp14mC4E7i383FgHRIXIsW6hWocGHyYT4GTBOwPO2%5FyZLs5sCbDesLHktkViOLS8Nm6AKcYt7IP8SWwKL6OUigZmmjXa04Ca-Xy8dGl57E2V2DO4Y%5FKaZgu75sZo%5FyisI5RCyDp-mLsj%5FQfuTvOY3fN-N%5FxPFeEd8PxC-RCwlnki5gxbihJ-8xYIvfH9tFyUDdvxB0CF7GCSkckYPUd797w/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h6/h001.uFgFD3dsp%5FQsjLK2x4gchpZqedpp8IHhtEXCWN%5FXseM) is really the icing on the cake. These guys are not secure. When they get hacked again, and they will, millions of peoples’ entire computer usage history, and all of their associated data will be leaked. 

 You might be wondering, how did they even get this through their internal safety teams? Well, they actually deliberately kept it hidden and away from them to avoid scrutiny. 

 Okay, this sounds bad and all but surely the data is encrypted on your device and can’t be accessed by remote users. 

 Nope. 

 The data is not even encrypted. Microsoft is taking screenshots of your computer, using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract all the text from the screenshot and then storing the text in a plain text database. No encrypting, nothing. 

 They also mention how it’s all happening locally, meaning no data is sent to Microsoft. They then say this. 

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/592x0,szmqWPlUeN_o7G-MJCYC_VfBdO0B2avcwMFMLVmq-BTc/https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9dc48b90-0995-4578-8a11-dd601e4480e5/image.png?t=1717819100)

 \> chip to the “cloud” 🤦 

 The funny thing is, in almost all of their comms, they keep using the word “snapshot”, not screenshot. Why, you may ask? 

 Because people understand what screenshot means, and how insecure that may be. An “encrypted snapshot” sounds much more secure than a screenshot, which is literally just a photo, a jpeg. 

 They also mention that it’s encrypted per user per device. This is also [completely false](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.SbcQNQnf%5FiEGRuRpooKUE5DeeYbttqyFk2tbtQcMufDsx%5FpYCiwYMIf53hw9jh78DlUbQTpz65rq4ulxG5tAd1ZJXiL-jdMR6fJBXnB4nqXfzcYkcFIV8IrBzEQXjddkE0NhcILP3fjEHmRyzRCrMufB8WPod%5FtO2IJ-J1wyGKXxFp5AWJwehihEGUTLhgGqBbb7%5Fl2WmeB4VbXjg9X5Z%5FHvPxewLnknIcVvewRkb1oB2fOIc5KnBmffuIKwrJ4dVDbfb85WJyfWv3Vn1SctjdkfGHo5Re1Fau0DZ0J8XAi%5FA6RQujBMFPk33vZW1Oxw/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h7/h001.8Xo0QeY1jmqCyRFQOMmKaD6fHRxMowIZ-OR1t5wBKQ0)! Any user on a computer could just go to “C//:Users” and go to another users account and look at their screenshots. 

 You may have missed something rather important there. You can access your screenshots yourself and delete them as you like. You know what that means? 

 Any software installed on your device can do this too. You have to be 100% certain that every single thing installed on your system won’t try and access your entire computer usage history. 

 Somebody has already built a tool to extract all the data saved by Recall and called it Total Recall. You can check it out [here](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.SjPexFjnPcmRCIFIyVXfb-rzZ9YiMzuH1pRX60VH1byzw15hoOFrykhmMThud1Au9QJKIgp7D58lkeNDZgJBv8wk9zfyPYqvcnMI1uYEN65WR6hhboJKMAgXa3X8uuKls2p-%5FdZ21fDR9l%5FIBjlzEhiItbNfLeCnhxwNqnTLAG-QTWLyBlGdsusIVkyw%5FopvhoWMgtGo2QlD95exugHR5Q/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h8/h001.GiaRwWjbUyv7zt0wo0pellxnJcGePVbtB6txt1P--zk).

 After a lot of noise and uproar on social media, Microsoft is finally walking back some things.

### Just the beginning

 Microsoft isn’t the only company going too far. Meta has made it incredibly difficult to turn off their ability to train their models using your data. 

 People have been trying to get in contact with Meta about turning this off and they literally just say ‘no’. You need to provide [concrete evidence](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.QrdFCFVMMDh8bI7FbOUOtm-gSm8iF5gJNWOe2NpJ0Rvxh6nygvytl-17-Tu6uUl1CejvgnC%5F0iRmlZEuVg4knQ67aDR6HnSH7Fz4lw0ZZl6tHbanH23ZPZ6TvZffmwEkXKbkXvI1G7%5FZn3yQKwYXDlWWpbO7KBGzcP0dIx8s%5F8nifksXxs50zHLACoRWwDHcB845Kw00E0uid1JVQgY9bg/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h13/h001.aOB3UOTf1mOYigTqlI8Ew1HWZp-t3lrQJ3gUGFRx4Ww) with screenshots of proof and corresponding prompts that show your data being used. If you don’t do this, they literally deny your request to train their models on your data. 

 The way they even talk about using your data is so obscure and the workflow to opt-out is ridiculous. Check out this thread for the ridiculous process \[[Link](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.QrdFCFVMMDh8bI7FbOUOtpjK7Lu4FMoOjArJUCTtOIZY8iU3753GHaptHEXRj4x14OZBrBUc2GWENGTNLuh7yIL-RfXmuhmbjp27aM6CJGMD7R0kZ4W2pRNX1wWsraQcy40KGHx14C%5FKOHdjCoahm5rvX9N8hBlawFZmJ8Th5lzzTbC-UYwc4NvLAnCwq6BWXF7akMe20eJHFKA81CryMsOCapr9-v8RpytW0rqTFD4/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h14/h001.ttIt1ANHFjiGu75ZJ8LY6jxb2waFUORP-BJnapNYOAU)\]. Many people have even commented saying that it straight up doesn’t work for them. Honestly, I can’t say I’m surprised. Check out these threads on how to opt-out \[[Link](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.QrdFCFVMMDh8bI7FbOUOtorKP2T2uLl2FiTkQ23slUoQh4ws1R6AS31ITcGNNsuJ9kkFuVLeQa6juZhziXvm0GFcK0yvtbGeNWW9zEp4qbbjmSIw%5FB1ZhMqCFdeb%5F3kD-1XUrfQ2Yu562SX0b8cbq666y1F1lYK7bRFPqnpCk9J%5FOkmZaCVFdivQDAyNsaBq1FyH57v4ExxfVZ5iZt5cf74JXikoT0SkkKiXkJIQPdk/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h15/h001.CmCo-MZfT8B0hUXHiLjwFOm91mXCnO%5FLPR27rS0QA9g)\] \[[Link](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.XiW3uyBR-hv9LJd49%5FWJjqBLRj1r8H8FDLCgOJ7K2h5aR%5FutZc5QLl6onZ2TCFw26iqUkLhSiU3BlPHQDV0p5FOGD8er57hic8ksH0EY%5FpFqhGuTFDSLB6AGs3YOcRhejq9l1CsgZ3TsmpfCjtWoedW9EbSKsUHtFot6LpiRbPnRYjWJsngF8gRWshcyoXL4Q7OHeQPQLGVUI8mwICcC2gJt%5FF5NViJ38UOJCnjtOckpG9cxQjvM0dsy1A5OSiH3/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h16/h001.QkQ410a1NDU5hNUo7UPYZ6iPux75%5Fw66XsSqSx6Xid4)\]. 

 One artist discusses how their opt-out request was denied. Why? 

 You have to find unmistakable proof someone is actively using your work with your name already. You can’t just say ‘no’…

People in the US don’t even seem to have the option of an opt-out compared to users in Europe and the UK. 

 What are we doing here? 

 We are starting to see just how far these companies will go to do what they want. There is so little privacy, and even less security. 

 Oh, and Adobe didn’t want to feel left out. Just look at this marvellous new license users are required to agree to.

 And if you’re wondering, yes, this is for AI training and generation. They can’t guarantee that their AI model won’t copy something it’s seen, so, they’ll just make it legal for it to copy absolutely anything. 

 Top strategy Adobe. Great job. 

## AI for me, but not for thee

 The Department of Homeland Security recently [announced ](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.XiW3uyBR-hv9LJd49%5FWJjpJpubDOLf20Q3ZrDb%5FJYLr024uD4-wdvDStIiuWtgQEwAqqeQn-csyZuR%5FGKvnibJNAoZxQlG7hh1ZNU8tCFQUZBDmBhVRJP-D0TNhYGaadGQJKgQKDilQX%5FEpg0xSBqzyuhgCV%5F876OKauQnqxKYtQU2Uv%5Fl3tmuelNRRUFX2HZjCkqe0wctpBxIHEf5HlePdHTN2coIuZ%5F8KMLFlkbm6enO8LtQ1U3BYnl3BqK6rA9rsCyuagkgJb1JOJXWw9gIYglUDeBMNjIwa4HxJD-PP5w2oTRkhIpwlsEkQJEe4Y/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h19/h001.gDqIygeFrKEvFv8-Q9416hq78-bOfCDcuix5gFzrUdU)the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board (AISSB). Sounds like a good idea, I mean, with AI disrupting every possible industry and affecting the entire internet, this is necessary. The only problem, however, is the people actually on the board.

 Genuinely, it’s actually horrifying reading this list of names. These guy are in charge of “safety and security”, consulting the US government? 

 God help us. 

 The aim of the board is to “develop recommendations to prevent and prepare for AI-related disruptions to critical services that impact national or economic security, public health, or safety”. This is all well and fine. 

 But this nugget from the secretary of Homeland security, who also happens to sit on the board, is one of the funniest things I’ve ever read.

 \> “This is not a mission that is about business development” 

 \> Proceeds to get the leaders of the most powerful **businesses** in the world, assuring us that they will definitely not act in the interest of their businesses and shareholders. 

 A group of people with, not only massive conflicts of interest, but also a shared goal to monopolise and gate keep AI, are here to protect us from AI. 

 There is definitely no conflict of interest here. None whatsoever. I mean, these people must take us all for fools, and since we literally can’t do a damn thing about it, I guess they’re right. 

 What’s worse is that half of these people know practically nothing about AI. CEO of Delta Airlines? Occidental Petroleum? None of this is by accident, and the most obvious tell is the fact that there is not even an attempt, they didn’t even try to make it seem like they cared about being bipartisan. 

 Where is Zuck? Yann Lecun? Hugging Face? I’m not exactly an Elon stan, but the guy has been talking about AI safety for the last decade. I hope Meta open sources their best models and destroys whatever advantage these clowns have. 

 I’d like to just point out, this is without a doubt, the absolute scariest scenario for AI. A handful of the largest companies on the planet not only develop and control how you use it, but they also police its creation and distribution. 

 This isn’t a board, this is a cartel. A syndicate. A mafia. 

 This is the doorway to a dystopia, and we’re already halfway through.

## This bubble is bubbling

 NVIDIA just won’t stop. Is this what the dot com bubble was like? Because this is insanity. 

 As of 6 June 2024, NVIDIA has surpassed Apple to become the 2nd most valuable company in the world with a market value of >$3 Trillion. 10 years ago, Apple’s market cap was 50x NVIDIA’s. 

 Just to put things into perspective, revenue and EBITDA for 2023: 

* APPLE - $400B & $125B
* NVIDIA - $60B and $30B

 NVIDIA’s stock is up 155% in 2024 **alone** and has added the entire value of Amazon in 6 months. NVIDIA accounts for 43% of the **entire** S&P 500’s YTD market cap. 

 This level of growth is hard to fathom. Mind you, this is happening while the US has [slowed down ](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.XiW3uyBR-hv9LJd49%5FWJjl-ebGnEHzwyi0vMCjIHyCpjj5uxY5VyrRP3MNncs2FqeqSGTQFwMHqeTvKM4TW2xbb%5FSJH191zIS0sl0XDdSDcKi4cHmoRcXmtSqRgo-6jz8eaGtHCcD3ijqYlDne8JyFBCK5TOqzUfYk5yG4pSkplSUoAQUfHaXWPh-ozMIvdOrnzcnApcsjBTrZ7F-afIazKNvkQeob%5FiLp6eiuzYZ8q8aAD6P59UM4jZE04mFH8jfO-cmh222PSSh%5Fg0iI4iH2i2W3WdlLh%5FbgKo-qjltog/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h24/h001.sEvHObHWY9Wlad2Xb7te%5FI2I3GHoOQkRjIytRstlz2Q)NVIDIA’s ability to sell chips to the UAE, which by the way, have ridiculous amounts of money to spend on AI chips. Don’t even get me started on the fact that China can’t even buy NVIDIA. 

 Can you even imagine what their stock would look like if China could buy their chips? 

 Unfathomable. 

Side note

 Just because China is banned from buying NVIDIA chips doesn’t mean Chinese companies aren’t getting their hands on them. It seems like Singapore may be [acting as a proxy](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.QrdFCFVMMDh8bI7FbOUOtgDk3z3%5FqFIN%5Fke8oKOvyLTAGH3w4jlgqXMrH5jehX9GfcgpwCDAnmj9y6xOerHxwAWgogHQHzfRoPDwNOeXli-mfH%5FG4g2kkH28w3%5F9fXsUbK31cW4kKfzvt%5FXzBlMFmJ8RrnT5ORnI%5FDptJX36waSddEzHyUkyQry2iWMYQvLENcl-90Apk7nelwBQwofVeU3ChcM7n2WpxzUu9pptahc/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h25/h001.k8kjlAlzgE9m-BhNMYPxhsh91ScX8C6RsP8R8dKSkL4) for Chinese companies. Companies based in Singapore spent a staggering $4 Billion on chips, making up \~15% of NVIDIA’s total revenue. 

 Also good luck to HR at NVIDIA. Imagine trying to convince the employees to stay when their stock options are all worth millions. Legitimately, working at NVIDIA right now is just about the greatest job in the world. Look at these comps…

 I have a feeling this scene will soon hit us. The amount of money being moved around in the name of AI is just absurd. 

 Elon Musk’s [X.AI](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.MpFYNfJOb77YY31ki5hVJkkLxKdWbBhvXoDGar314W8NAj-imR9HaiYBYOBiHlbNy4zDl8ZpvidTmrVx7YyNGNy4joHnuktCbIUVrE%5FuXKvBeHZ%5FvNvMbQoHkoHj%5Flyvdb7R-OGCkPvb6AjOrbRVL4pJHtUH5vnypT0kxC1pz%5Fc/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h27/h001.fGhBOwLnpha4Ja2jDhLi4Jr8UdrHJJlQaE1CVCsQR00) recently raised, as far as I can tell, the single largest investment in history. 

**$6 Billion.** 

 Not a $6 Billion valuation, a $6 Billion raise of money. Do you know where most of that money is going? 

 NVIDIA. 

 How do I know this? 

 Musk recently [re-routed 12K GPUs](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.XiW3uyBR-hv9LJd49%5FWJjshNz0L68Lbgwxj%5FyMYOsedVTvfNMiYkUPS0TkPaYYcO4iU1PRq%5FG2DEanL1j3ml5190aWqQriaUzkA86ASz6SgxOqrZZjmLLCduictiJBqW6raCvNnQ0am6l%5F4Pl7wByfffPPBebUeMJp38SXJejF5nmYXBjpN-UGsEar8qnECUJBF8Ct0ShtMJjzSZHIG9n8ntdYJP01IktUhXSCAL-ZZ1gmAsSds6AKbzVjXDpoSIh0Asdxb7jU%5FiTbAz%5FJrorxrDxV1M%5FLvJ4DzK8PQQ2g1PI7R3I3d-5Eu7WW8Lys4g/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h28/h001.ugVLFX5%5Fa9fXPKlT2HMvCNx6kPWqaYm%5FsBTWgmTA2C4) meant for Tesla to [X.AI](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.MpFYNfJOb77YY31ki5hVJkkLxKdWbBhvXoDGar314W8NAj-imR9HaiYBYOBiHlbNy4zDl8ZpvidTmrVx7YyNGNy4joHnuktCbIUVrE%5FuXKvBeHZ%5FvNvMbQoHkoHj%5Flyvdb7R-OGCkPvb6AjOrbRVL4pJHtUH5vnypT0kxC1pz%5Fc/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h29/h001.IEjk0TBXNzpOdBvwFQOkNLpa85rI9Fi2bEWrX6bFGN0). That’s worth just over half a billion dollars, but that’s not that much when you look at what he’s building. 

 A 100K H100 GPU cluster. This would be the single largest supercomputer in the world, and he [claims](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.QrdFCFVMMDh8bI7FbOUOtkI6G96ergM1oqxHYtJglPK4D5lxjMU1AZGxgy7E7kw9QEy7HnnfBLqtsCYwrXYVwY9CrFZcQK9Zv-jT4OUU8XlsVrq9XTtUn1A2tTgVoeGyJHOWzSdyQ2uNsGTbuzeFdRNzCEagkMZbnwFyxRYf3JRZCDGTQRXrrR4do2qZnubY1qHzBhP0hUYw%5F8okuwCgscFaluJQ6%5FuCWzRlbkicC3Q/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h30/h001.bFV7lkwKCrAWfGle9%5FVDKVt2iZ4dTrMyQQTm%5FaGS2pM) it’ll be done in a few months. The size of the next set of supercomputers is going to be absolutely mind boggling, and a single company is funding every single one of them. 

 Have fun competing with that. 

 If you’re wondering what kind of companies are being formed from all this insanity, look no further than the following. 

 Eric Schmidt’s (former CEO of Google) new startup, [Augment](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.B15%5FaJmerLCCTMfALwSCYx3tyUtbuABPjjK33coKY5M7apqG1rb6QfGOYTueWQcqZHhAdhUtozVqW%5FZB68rcPN2KG7A54kpYi%5FVYHKxgqVpajzPIjLXy4B7VffWsTIk-f9Bjd0gVtrFj4nWK9P8I1vBt01tyXGTDFttYjyWIhuc12R0dMAwhLbRb7SrAt3TY0ujRVR%5FOx194hLByTBdI94iSBJtepBxIerTSQW-kxteTp8hWazUuxSpdHfc3rUs3ai-n9wwiJmaGQ0yFIfgBm6qrHrHGMIj8WI9gAB89dv2V3ebzZvDF4ceG-tidbOWr/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h31/h001.-VvIfiwSkFBVurvzmHRGOaIDGVVqjrvzFzY8u1IbPOw), just came out of stealth having raised $252M, with a post-money valuation of $977M; basically unicorn status. They have a bunch of execs with no background in this type of work, and they use fine-tuned “industry-leading” open models of some sort. 

 But the craziest part is, they have 50 employees. What on earth are you doing with that many employees so early? 

 Legal startup ‘Harvey' is once again looking to [raise](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.XiW3uyBR-hv9LJd49%5FWJjlj80lEeeG%5FNuzZDtfwkBXYpS4elcCX51dW5u2MhS5d395%5FO1WCAoeeW03vTBDNFL6UTtOzM2zDrEgkiKWrkNy4A8mLzwpGxGeH7cotHWWNFG1Y5cf1ORdEEaUkE1miTYXMJ68Q%5FEOGGPG%5F7sg2S%5F2NreQ92fMOEbIfj6jxDCLEkHhuE2E0tpV4f4-OjfY1JMatUTqbg4e8aYYQzJVVFkBXKEqUSWtertaPpZd2XPLSe41WIPbArw2S8Y32mt1gHmbnPSgjnmq9qJ8-8TVcu2rJ937qIqRKB1Ve5Czu1dOTx/471/hF3XQx4VSJ-1Fl8oTFwr6g/h32/h001.SZjVLDwD4GHG-c9uD12PClyBxMO7PsmTMRodOmKiE7U) over $600M on a $2 Billion valuation. Their last reported revenue? $10 Million. 

 Mind you, this is all happening while things are (kind of) slowing down and people are starting to realise the limitations of LLMs. You can’t just plug an LLM into your business and hope for the best. 

 You need systems, processes around them. 

 Genuinely curious to see how things play out moving forward, especially towards the end of the year where we’ll finally see what the next set of AI models will look post GPT-4\. 

 It may seem insane, and to some extent, it absolutely is. These companies are betting that the first-movers will win. The mindset is - If you don’t adopt AI, there is zero chance you won’t get out-innovated by a company who does. 

 Guess we’ll find out if they’re right.
