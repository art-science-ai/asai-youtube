Now it’s time for you to do three things: 

**WRITE, READ and [RESTACK](https://substack.com/redirect/2976b8ed-0f30-4e28-bd26-6258c58fe88e?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)!**

1. **WRITE** and share your story based on the June Prompt  
[![June 2024 The Great Substack Prompt Celebration](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/140x140,sQZOSQ_KWtmJn21eJYgRP5O5XlABUx4FEz-OrsKhUUVk/https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74527582-8c65-4dcd-a2ad-e5c643d62566_1456x1048.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/2cdd8ded-c589-46d1-8edf-0bfd28cfaaeb?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)

2. **READ** the other stories shared in the thread, and
3. **[RESTACK](https://substack.com/redirect/2976b8ed-0f30-4e28-bd26-6258c58fe88e?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI)** the stories you read in Substack Notes to expand the discoverability of all the participants in this prompt party! (One of my fav ways to do this is by highlighting a favorite sentence and restacking with that. More about restacking [here](https://substack.com/redirect/2976b8ed-0f30-4e28-bd26-6258c58fe88e?j=eyJ1Ijoibm10MnYifQ.NjEarT2ZIO18IdxC9k5a0j0BJcwjvF6cgtuRD-MCySI).)
