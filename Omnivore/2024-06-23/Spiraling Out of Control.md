Fine tuning

**Anthropic’s new AI model is twice the speed, 1/5th the cost.** I can’t think of a previous technology that has achieved this level of cost and performance improvements—and all in just one year! If the trend line continues for [another five](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8veC5jb20vbWlrZXlrL3N0YXR1cy8xODAzNzkxMDExODI4NzExOTMwIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjIxfQ==), we are living in an entirely different technological age. Along with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the company released ["artifacts,"](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzYvMjAvMjQxODE5NjEvYW50aHJvcGljLWNsYXVkZS0zNS1zb25uZXQtbW9kZWwtYWktbGF1bmNoIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjIyfQ==) a way to visualize the inner workings of the chatbot (for example, by showing you the code of what it’s making). 

**Anthropic finally has a corporate strategy—it’s B2B SaaS.** In the same post announcing the new model, the company [stated](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFudGhyb3BpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9jbGF1ZGUtMy01LXNvbm5ldCIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjoyM30=), 

> “This preview feature marks Claude’s evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. It’s just the beginning of a broader vision for Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the near future, teams—and eventually entire organizations—will be able to securely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate.”

In _Rick and Morty_, Rick makes an [AI robot while eating breakfast](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9WDdIbWx0VVdYZ3NcdTAwMjZ0PTFzIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjI0fQ==). After the robot grabs Rick butter for his pancakes, the robot asks, “What is my purpose?” to which Rick replies, “You pass butter.” The robot, filled with self-awareness, looks forlornly at its hands and exclaims, “Oh my God.” I have to imagine that if Claude becomes self-aware and is told its job is to “centralize knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space,” it would have a similar reaction. 

In the non-science-fiction reality in which we currently reside, this strategy actually makes sense. The output of an LLM is only as good as the prompt it is given and the data it can reference. Finding ways to embed the AI into your system is a viable strategy for these model providers. It will be fascinating to see with whom and how these SaaS partnerships are structured. My guess is that the company will start with the smaller players like Notion before trying to strike a deal with Salesforce or Hubspot. 

**$0 to $35 million in annualized revenue in a year.** When an AI startup strikes oil, the resulting well gushes with money.

This undoubtedly is a point solution, so I’m curious to see how the company tries to extend it. Do you add more AI offerings? Do you try to capture more traditional marketing SaaS spend? My bet is the former. 

**No product + no revenue = $2 billion valuation.** [Poolside.AI](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvb2xzaWRlLmFpLyIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjoyN30=) is in talks to raise over [$400 million](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNi8yMC9wb29sc2lkZS1yYWlzaW5nLTQwMG0tYXQtYS0yYi12YWx1YXRpb24tZm9yLXN1cGVyY2hhcmdlZC1jb2RpbmctY29waWxvdC8iLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6Mjh9) at a $2 billion-plus valuation. While these numbers are large, it is not worth trying to say that this is the valuation. Instead, view this as a call option on a wholly different world. If just one of these foundation model companies achieves its vision (a big if), a $2 billion valuation will look cheap. This isn’t yet a business—it's a high-potential science project.

**Apple takes the Vision Pro out to pasture.** Despite my steadfast love for the device, the Vision Pro headset has continued to undersell.

**Not quite the dot-com bubble, but close.** Speaking of spicy valuations, investors are paying a lot for big tech, but still not quite as much as they were back in 1999:

Median price-earnings ratio (i.e., profit multiple) of the S&P's top 10 stocks is nearly at the ZIRP peak . . . but it's still lower than the peak of the dot-com bubble. Investors are paying approximately $30 for every $1 of profit, which is roughly a 3 percent yield. It’s a strange investment to make when a savings account can fetch close to 5 percent, especially when savings accounts are considerably less risky than stocks. But, as pricey as stocks are, they’re still not as pricey as they were when everyone was partying like it’s 1999\. For now, Nvidia & co. keep delivering earnings growth, and if you’re looking for upside, it’s pretty much the only game in town.—[_Moses Sternstein_](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJhbmRvbXdhbGsuY28vIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjM0fQ==)

**Self-fulfilling prophecies.** People have been talking about the dangers of technology in one form or another for thousands of years. Icarus used his artificial wings to fly too close to the sun and died. The golem, a mythical creature created to protect a community, became uncontrollable and unleashed violent destruction. The moral is always the same: With great power comes great responsibility. I recently came across a more recent—and optimistic—prophecy by Indian philosopher and mystic J. Krishnamurti, who talked about [superintelligence](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9S3V0NUtBbDNVYlkiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6Mzd9) in 1981 to a group of college students in Madras. With some power of foresight, he predicted that intelligent computers would guide humanity down one of two paths: Either we’re sedated by endless entertainment, or we use technology as a way to turn inward and reaffirm what it means to be human. I lean toward the second path, because technology is just a mirror reflecting our deepest potential. Yes, the sun may burn. But it also illuminates.—[_Ashwin Sharma_](https://every.to/emails/click/6dc913eaf276f72ae60d9f5a14cfccd0ee00c1461a16b07f3deec67276660365/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiU3BpcmFsaW5nIE91dCBvZiBDb250cm9sIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzEzNywicG9zdF90eXBlIjoicG9zdCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8veC5jb20vQXNod2lucmVhZHMiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6Mzh9)
