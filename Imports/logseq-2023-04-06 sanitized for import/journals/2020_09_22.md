- QS Call with [[EY]]
	 - Intro: what EY users need:
		 - Want to understand the structure of data

		 - Cookbook of best practices for common use cases with snippets of queries / full queries

	 - Q: What is the technical proficiency of users?
		 - Users know SQL (or they will go elsewhere to learn SQL), but they do not understand the structure of the underlying data.

		 - E.g. look at BigQuery - they have good tutorials with documentation links. AEP tutorials need not focus on SQL basics, but rather on the specifics of our data structures.

	 - Q: What are your main use cases?
		 - Use case 1: Creating / replicating segments using SQL.

		 - EY team to get back with a list of use-cases

	 - Data layout
		 - How is data organized in data lake? (E.g. time based?) What are the best practices for querying? Need this to be included in documentation.

	 - Entitlement limits (e.g. concurrency)
		 - EY would like UI to indicate the current usage vs. limits. 

	 - Performance expectations
		 - What is the expected performance for query types? This should ideally be displayed in the UI.

	 - CJA / QS use cases
		 - EY team to get back with their use cases around interoperability between CJA and Query Service.

	 - Other suggestions
		 - Keep the documentation in a Github repo so that users can contribute PRs (Don't use a forum)!

- [[CJA]] meeting with [[EY]]
	 - What is the use case of stitching Analytics data to other datasets?
		 - We want to know customers' journeys, actions, content preferences.

		 - Analytics is tied to all business scenarios.

- [[Expedia]] account meeting with [[Tony Galindo]] and team on [[Expedia Experimentation - AEP engagement]]
	 - Overall
		 - Tony asked if I was already working with Vinod.

		 - Total ARR: $15.6 M

		 - Expedia wants to migrate from AA to CJA / AEP; because they migrated from client side to server side data collection.

	 - QS: Experimentation team adoption of QS & DSW

- Meeting with [[Trevor Paulsen]]
	 - Experimentation / statistics is a very common use case for CJA customers. Outlying IDs / statistical comparisons / AB testing / etc.  is a common reason why customers want to use.

	 - Luby's idea: Composition view is an AEP concept that will replicate data views in CJA. But this may be a bad idea.

	 - What's Expedia's problem? Performance is one issue. Operating on the same datasets. Best Buy, Home Depot, Sony all have this issue.
		 - DONE Write requirements for Expedia
