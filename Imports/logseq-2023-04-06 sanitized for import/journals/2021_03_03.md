	 - DONE Enterprise sync #[[QS-export]]
		 - Not all events come from sources; Lots of events come from internal sources - offer decisioning, journey orchestration

		 - Should not be biased towards batch use cases - Enterprise sync should enable batch and streaming use cases

		 - Nat West use case - Analytics events need to be forwraded from Hub to Kinesis end-point

		 - Limitations of existing destinations - they focus on Profile store; not doing it at dataset level

		 - Two use cases we should focus on: 
			 - Batch datastes with sql prep

			 - Streaming datasets in Profile store

			 - Combination of streaming and batch
