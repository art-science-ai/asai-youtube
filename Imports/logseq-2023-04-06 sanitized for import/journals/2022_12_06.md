- [[[[Projects]]-MPC]] SG STO review w [[Fred Leach]], [[Sagar Pilania]], [[Igor Borojevic]], [[Tal Hayat]], [[Maxime Boucher]], [[Damien Lefortier]], [[Shabnam Erfani]], etc.
	 - Topic 1: TEE
		 - TEE is a needed to meet Google's privacy sandbox requirements; that's the main benefit, and it's important (Fred)

		 - We need to figure out if this is really a hard requirement for Google (Sagar)

		 - TEE general demand may rise (Nitin) - but we need more validation on this (Fred)

	 - Topic 2: Private Delivery
		 - NM: Insurance policy that can replace all AEMv2 - how important and when do we need this by? - Not asked but answered

		 - NM Qs: 
			 - Ranking, Cali, Infra: Need a follow-up on tranche 2 allocation

			 - How do we get to scale: If we don't get to 2% scale

		 - Tranche 2 allocation happens in early Jan

		 - AEMv2 moves to MPC by 2025-end (Fred says we committed to board)

	 - My takeaways
		 - Based on "Source of Truth" document to be published in January, Signal Growth leads will prioritize HC allocation (BIS and/or incremental) for Private Delivery

- 1-1 

- 1PD a/b testing
	 - Thanks all for participating! I believe we aligned on these next steps (please keep me honest):

1/ Chuan to own the framework with consulting inputs from others in this group (doc linked in chat description)

2/ Provide a directional update to leads mid next week on minimum thresholds Meta Pay needs to meet for expected A/B test results to be detectible
