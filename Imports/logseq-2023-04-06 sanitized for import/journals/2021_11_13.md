		 - This journey was different.

		 - First tI thought i was understanding the feminine. Going inside the vagina. But it was still in the journey / sleeping abag / camp matrix  The camp and the meditation and the tent. I twas all there. It was smooth sailing.

		 - It was as though I conne ted to a deeper, swiser handle on h reality 

		 - I need to get in touch with this wiser handle on reality every s so often. I  need this in my life.

		 - I want to share it with Rukma.

		 - What if Rukma can experience this sense of reality. Th edeeper journeys. I want her to journey with me. 

		 - This is a deep an mystical experience. 

		 - I still keep visualizin g Robert Jordan's weheel of time. As if I am going through the journey. I am traveling through Tel'aran'rhiad. This time with the woem this time with the women giuding me

		 - Mtthew cares so much about these small things.  It doesn't matter. None of these small things matter. We're all OK. there's a reality behind reality that's guiding us all. I havea ccess to this reality behind reality. 

		 - What were the visuals I experienced?

		 - Traveling on a flying carpet with nyneve, egweane, and elayne.
