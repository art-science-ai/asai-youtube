- DONE Deepak invite to MBA #[[[[Projects]]-Work-misc]] #2022-W7
	 - Thank you very much Deepak! I actually wanted to reach out to you about another topic: I'm one of the leaders of MBAs@Adobe, a community of 400+ active participants across Adobe, and we'd like to invite you to participate in a 1-hour executive speaker session to address the MBA community.Past speakers have included Shantanu Narayen, Anil Chakravarthy, David Wadhwani, Bryan Lamkin, and Todd Gerber to name a few.

	 - We generally have about 50 people attending and try to keep it pretty casual with no formal slides necessary (unless you prefer to use them).  

	 - The event format is roughly 30 minutes of me interviewing you on pre-arranged topics (e.g. leadership, your career path to Adobe, and Product Management more generally), and then 30 minutes of Q&A from the audience. If interested, I could send you a more firmed up brief with all the pre-arranged questions, topics, etc.

	 - Please let me know if this is something you’d be open to participating in, thank you!
