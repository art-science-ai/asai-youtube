	- As described in section 2.8.1 of our lease agreement, the main options are:
		- 1) Either party decides to terminate the tenancy
		- 2) Both parties sign a new lease
		- 3) We do nothing, in which case the tenancy continues on a month-to-month basis on the same terms and conditions of expired lease
	- My preference is for option 3, but happy to discuss over the call and hopefully align on a mutually agreeable option!

	- General feedback on goals
		- Focus on 1PD HVR and have big impact rather than a bunch of side projects
	- Feedback from Mandeepak
		- (+) Mandeepak thinks I am doing IC6 role - very complicated space already
		- (+) I'm taking on more ownership and driving things
		- (-) Holding myself accountable to timelines and proactive communication when timeline is slipping
			- I think I'm not aligned on the timeline and importance
		- (-) I'm not doing a good job of setting the right expectations and timelines
			- Need to understand the decision maker's perspective and what information is needed
			- Help Yoav understand the problem - e.g. how do we trade-off and prioritize
		- (+/-) I'm very good at developing the frameworks, but not great at filling in the details and driving the details of that
	- MC sizing
		- Experimental solution - QRT that turns on / off different things
		- Measure total 1PD impact - but not individually attributable - measure total impact by experiment and dedup analytically
