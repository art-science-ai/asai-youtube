		 - Users in auto-open cohort
			 - "Auto-open promo" shown in place of "return big promo" (once every 7 days on the first fully qualified file) until the user chooses "once" or "always".

			 - If a user taps “always”, they won't see the promo until they manually turn off auto-open (then they will start seeing the auto-open promos again).
