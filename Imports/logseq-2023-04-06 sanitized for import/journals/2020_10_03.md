- Planning [[Wedding Part 1]]

- Message to parents
	 - Hey guys, we made bookings for you guys and for Rukma's family at the Hyatt hotel in Redmond (link below). You're booked there from 21st - 25th. We still need to make a plan for the last 2 nights (after Rukma's family leaves on 25th, the 4 of us can go on a short trip). I've also booked a car for the entire time (we'll have an SUV for 21 - 25, and then a Tesla for our last two days trip), so we can pick you guys up from the airport and stuff. Let us know if there's anything else you need help with. Looking forward! :)
