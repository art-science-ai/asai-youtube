	 - Taking 350mg ketamine. 10 mins sublingual.

	 - Journal after journey.

	 - That was a full on trip for at least thirty minutes. I started thinking about wheel of Time again. Because it was on my mind. I thought I was entering tell arandrial or ehatchukaycalliy.

	 - Visually I was being transported. First I was with rukma Piyush and Monika, and they were all giving me a send off into another world. A ritual send off. Then I closed my eyes. Then I was underwater again. I was hovering above the world looking down on it. Looking at different scenes from different perspectives. I would often start with the first person perspective, then zoom out into something else. I was in the camping tent sleeping. Then the tent dissolved and the blue filled my consciousness. Then I was going to meet the dark one. It was a grey zone.
