		 - Intro
			 - Everything I do here is audited - nothing funky can happen!

			 - Only queries is relevant table; other tables are not relevant; maybe statistics table - ask Gautam

			 - 3000 RU = Resource Units

			 - SELECT top 100 * from q ORDER BY q.created DESC

			 - Need to use top instead of 100

			 - Table q = THIS table, because no joins are possible.

		 - Why the limit of 1000? Can I get more? Need entire months.
			 - Entire month

	 - Grafana
		 - Grafana vs CosmosDB
			 - CosmosDB keeps state - that's the main goal; metrics is just a side goal

		 - What's the data here coming from?
			 - Underlying data is from the metrics SDK; this feeds into Grafana.

			 - DONE Metrics SDK API can give me access directly (Ask Surya)
