- [[Waymo]] On-Site for Sim Role w [[Benjamin Frenkel]]
	 - Intro
		 - PM for sim / realism

		 - Make the simulator indistinguishable from real world driving

		 - Want to get to a point where testing in sim is as good as testing in the real world

	 - Closing Qs
		 - Remaining interviews

	 - Other interviews
		 - Lili - planner evaluation; Ben's customer for agents; Lili is the customer; I'll be collaborating with her 

		 - Raz - senior eng w lot of experience; getting a sense of my technical aptitude; how I'm like to work with

	 - Org structure
		 - Ben - sim agents, simulation city team (synthetic cities, longer trips - blog post), sensor simulation, realism (measuring realism)

		 - Agents team - research team, production team  

- [[Waymo]] On-Site for Sim Role w [[Raz Mathias]]
	 - Case
		 - Context
			 - Launching on road

			 - Large simulation - expensive and manual process

			 - Expensive because of crappy simulator

			 - Recall oriented simulation - then goes to human triage; real collision vs false collision 

		 - Problem
			 - 400 engineers on-board motion planning team; e.g. working on lane change; won't know if they introduced any new changes

			 - Instead we do A/B simulation - pre-submit experiment; tell you all the metrics difference between A & B
				 - Smaller test with denser metrics

				 - Avoid human triage

				 - Yielding inappropriately on a left turn (and getting stuck in a red light) - count and magnitude 

			 - Simulator has a lot of bias

			 - Distrust of simulator

			 - Distrust of metrics

			 - Q: I'm PM for Pre-submit system; how to control for quality

		 - Metrics
			 - High level metrics - overall health

	 - Org structure of sim team
		 - 150 eng

		 - data science - statistical correctness, bias variance, etc.

		 - core simulator - scaling quantity and quality of simulation

		 - scenarios 

		 - Teams work with research as well

	 - Issues
		 - A/B vs. expensive process? Got it.

		 - Waymo driver is different from other drivers we want to simulate (good driver vs random driver)

	 - About Raz
		 - Started the sim/eval team and ran it up to 50 ppl size

		 - Changed from M to IC; works between research and product

		 - Bridging research and product

		 - 

- [[Waymo]] On-Site for Sim Role w [[Lili Jiang]]
	 - Intro
		 - EM on planner eval team

		 - Develop safety metrics to evaluate safety of motion planner

		 - Just starting to leverage simulation; driving testing is not scaling as the bugs 

		 - Increased usage more in the last year; 

		 - Alternative to simulation - playing back logs

	 - Behavioral
		 - Customer interaction

		 - Disagreement with customer

	 - Case study
		 - Stack
			 - Perception

			 - Prediciton

			 - Planning

		 - Context
			 - I'm PM for perception

			 - Car is bad at dealing with three-wheeled vehicle

			 - Mose safety critical interactions dealing with these vehicles

			 - Assemble PMs from across the stack to solve the issue

			 - Not my only focus

	 - End questions - about role
		 - Ask 1 - need sim agents
			 - Want sim agents behavior to be suitable for their purpose; want it to be realistic

			 - Scope is expanding

		 - Ask 2 - more types of agents

	 - Stakeholders
		 - Planner eval - 
			 - Lili - works on risk sub-team of planner eval

			 - Other team looks at big releases
