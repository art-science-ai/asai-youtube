	 - Message to Prajakti Iyer
		 - Hi Prajakti — Hope you're doing well! :) My name is Nikhil Maddirala, and I got your contact information from my colleague Shilpa Javali at Adobe. I had a couple of queries about my NRO+NRE account at Kotak bank, and I was wondering if you might be able to help answer my questions! We could either have a quick 5 minutes call when you're free, or I can just message you my questions on WhatsApp. Whichever you prefer. Thanks very much in advance for any help you can offer! :)
