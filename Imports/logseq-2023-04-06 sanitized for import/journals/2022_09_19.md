	 - Good morning, Damien! Sagar said you are looking for a PM to drive product strategy for 1PD in ads ranking, and he asked me to work with you on this. Shall I reach out to Helen Gu to find us some time for a 1-1 to sync on this in the next few days? Meanwhile, please let me know if there's anything I can do to get up to speed. Look forward to working with you on this!

	 - Noah is ery bullish on this

	 - Why didn't private lift work out?
		 - They couldn't find the right higher up people at Google to negotiatie with - only found lower level people

	 - Competition risk
