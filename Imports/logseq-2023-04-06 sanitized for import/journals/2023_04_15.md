	- Why we are moving
		- We've lived in the Peninsula (in San Mateo) as well as the South Bay (in San Jose and Cupertino - where we currently live), and decided that the Peninsula is where we want to settle down.
		- explored a few different parts of the Bay Area, including the  San Jose (2020 - 2021), San Mateo (2021-2022), and Cupertino (2022-2023), and ultimately decided that San Mateo is our favorite place so that's where we want to live. We eventually want to buy a house in San Mateo few years down the line when we have kids - but want to rent for the next couple of years! 😊
