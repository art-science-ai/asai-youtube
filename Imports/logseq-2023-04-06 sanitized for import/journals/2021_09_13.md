- [[Therapy]] w [[Jurgen Braungardt]]
	 - I'm getting better at recognizing my feelings and sensations (e.g. when I get sad and I feel like I'm about to cry)

	 - This is more focused on the negative feelings, but I'm not observing the positive feelings

	 - Personality disorder
		 - OCPD

		 - What is personality?

		 - Jurgen doesn't believe too much in these specific diagnoses; they are just heuristics

		 - Self-diagnosis is a good first step; can go deeper with psychoanalysis

	 - OCPD
		 - It's a method to freeze anxiety

		 - For me, it could be due to emotional abandonment from parents, leads me to feeling lost or abandoned

		 - My OCPD is a set of systems to overcome that feeling of lost

	 - Super-ego
		 - I've formed a very strong super-ego - internalized version of my parents and culture - and that judges my behavior.

		 - This internalization process happens in childhood

	 - This process of internalization has had all these effects on me - lack of positive emotion, lack of organic motivation, lack of creativity, lack of resilience
