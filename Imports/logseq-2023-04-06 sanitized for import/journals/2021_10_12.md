		 - Hey Aditya — I'm traveling to India for my wedding in December, and I'm planning to be on PTO for a little under three weeks (12/6 - 12/23) leading up to our shutdown. I've only used about a week of PTO so far this year, so I hope this will be alright, but please do let me know if you have any concerns. Thank you! (Travel plans were still up in the air until the US - India travel ban just got lifted this week).
