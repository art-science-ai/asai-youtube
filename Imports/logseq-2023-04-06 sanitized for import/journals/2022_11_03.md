		- Hi Vibha, hope you're doing well! Our signal loss team has some problems with the existing infra capacity planning process. We have described the problems and proposed solutions in this doc, and we are seeking your help in finding the right STO to own and drive this process forward:

- [[[[Projects]]-MPC]] Volkswagen call w [[Silvia Potempa]]
	- Cover: Vokswagen, Audi, Porsche
	- Cover Tier 1 and Tier 2 advertising - national and regional
	- Background: Based in NYC, focused on dealer group
	- VW is very brand-safe; currently using custom conversions; want to switch to custom conversions
	- VW is a global account with JBP - Joint Business Partnership with Meta - about 30 accounts in Meta have this; it's a big deal
	- Sizes: VW, Audi, Porsche
	- Microchip shortage affected auto industry a lot - no cars to sell, long waitlist, big hit to ad spending. Before that full funell - brand, video views, conversions
	- Conversions: start building your own config, complete building, shopping tool - these for tier 1
	- Tier 2: dealer site handoff - sending you to the dealership handoff link, lead form  submissions
	- Last qtr fully brand focused - awareness, engagement, video views - because of chip shortage
	- 3 types of dynamic ads - product catalog ads - shows different product for different user - shows different regions - model ads - shows different models to different users
	- Standard vs custom event: standard - within system, add to cart, purchase, view content, etc. That's standardized across different advertisers
	- Custom conversions have lower signal; custom has higher CPC
	- Currently using pixel, trying to switch to CAPI; more privacy secure; can pass more signal; also to counteract cookie depracation
	- DONE Send thanks to people
