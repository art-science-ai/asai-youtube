	 - Leaving Adobe agenda
		 - I'm planning to move on from this job and from Adobe

		 - I will explain why I'm making this decision, but firstly I want to thank you for being a great manager over the past year
			 - You gave me a lot of independence and scope.

			 - You trusted me to make product decisions without micro managing

			 - I could rely on you to provide support whenever needed 

			 - This trust, independence and support enabled me to grow into a Sr. PM

			 - I'm really thankful for that.

		 - Primary reason for leaving: comp
			 - Current compensation
				 - Meta: 390k

				 - +40% / +$100k

			 - Future comp
				 - Meta: target refreshers 200k / yr

				 - Adobe: got +10% base + 50k last year, 0 in prior two years

				 - Next year - I run out of initial RSU grant and comp will go down even more

			 - Conclusion
				 - Other than comp, I do really like my job - great manager, great team - eng+PM, great product

				 - My goals: saving to buy a house and start a family

				 - Staying at Adobe is not a good financial decision for me

		 - Timeline / next steps
			 - I wanted to give you AS MUCH advance notice as possible

			 - Last date: Friday, May 20th

			 - almost 4 weeks out

- [[Therapy]] w [[Jurgen Braungardt]]
	 - Agenda
		 - Wanted to discuss family planning

		 - But I want to take a break from therapy in a bit due to job change
