- Search meeting w [[Randy Swineford]], [[LN]], [[Cindy Yang]], [[Bea Alessio]]
	 - LN's search vision
		 - •**__Domain-aware__**: understanding the entities, terminology, categories, and attributes of each specific use case and corpus of documents, not just leveraging generic statistics on strings of text.

		 - •**__Contextual & Personalized__**: able to take user context (location, last search, profile, previous interactions, user recommendations, and user classification), query context (other keywords, similar searches), and domain context (inventory, business rules, domain-specific terminology) in order to better understand user intent.

		 - •**__Conversational__**: able to interact in natural language and guide users through a multi-step discovery process while learning and remembering relevant new information along the way.

		 - •**__Multi-modal__**: able to resolve text queries, voice queries, search using images or video, or even monitor for events and send event-based pushed notifications.

		 - •**__Intelligent__**: able to deliver predictive type-ahead, to understand what users mean (spelling correction, phrase and attribute detection, intent classification, conceptual searching, and so on) to deliver the right answers at the right time and to be constantly getting smarter.

		 - •**__Assistive__**: moving beyond just delivery of links and information to delivering answers and action.
