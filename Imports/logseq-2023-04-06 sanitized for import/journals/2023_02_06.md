- Misc
	 - TODO MacOS Personal Google Drive sync error - compare folders #[[[[Projects]]-Personal-IT]]

	 - DONE Car air freshners

- 1-1 [[Mandeepak Singh]]
	 - Agenda 
		 - When are you back?

		 - Short term - 3 priorities
			 - PXFN
				 - More complex - it is actually "new data"

			 - A/B test

			 - HC and Capacity workstreams

		 - Longer term - discuss when you're back
			 - Summit / knowledge sharing

	 - DONE PXFN - Apurva LH sync - are we on the same page #[[[[Projects]]-1PD]] #2023-W6 [[February 8th, 2023]]

	 - HC allocation doc
		 - 4 PIDs allocated from Commerce to Junbiao

		 - 2 PIDs from tranche 2 track 2 to Junbiao

		 - + 0.5 HC pre-allocated

		 - DONE HC tracking #[[[[Projects]]-1PD]]

	 - Capacity
		 - Commerce said it's too much ask - like 50% of their T1s

		 - Need escalation to ABP leadership - can they transfer some capacity for 3 months to 1PD bets? How does this impact Adscore?

		 - Can I work with Shuai to figure out how much machine we REALLY need? What's the % of CPU utilization? 

		 - DONE Capacity tracking
			 - How well have we vetted these capacity numbers? What's the minimum?

			 - Have they been signed off?

			 - Can we serialize the work? Meta XO first then Pay?

	 - Design issues
		 - AdConv threw a wrench in our plans

		 - We can make a hacky workaround for phase 1, but we want the system to be extensible to phase 2

		 - Currently a blocker for production (IAW LH) but not for testing (Meta Pay / XO)

	 - Long term strategy
		 - Ultimately want to get to iRev / Adscore

		 - Start with feature level gaps - how to prioritize which features

	 - Offsite to explain Yuhui's playbook

	 - DONE Plan w Mandeepak

- A/B test meeting w [[Chuan Goh]], [[Adam Hardy]], [[Grant Swinton]]
	 - Adam is on Ugene's team

	 - Grant Swinton - Meta Checkout DS team

	 - Grant says they were never thinking about testing ranking model changes

	 - Grant's test is expected in July / August

	 - Talk to business team on what is being tested - total impact vs.
