	 - Hi Brett and Fred, hope you're doing well! We are in the early stages of exploring product strategy for MPC-ML in Ads Delivery, and we are seeking your opinion on whether we can use third party conversion data from ATT opted-out users in the manner described in this proposal. Look forward to your comments and feedback. Thanks in advance!
