- [[Mock PM Interview]] practice - Overcast {{POMO  15}}
	 - Goals and objectives
		 - Context: Used by people who want to discover and listen to podcasts

		 - Business objectives: Improve user engagement

	 - Users
		 - Lite users - occasionally listen to podcasts recommended by friends; subscribe to 1-2 podcasts

		 - Medium users - subscribe to 5+ podcast shows; listen multiple times per week; discover new podcasts

		 - Power users - subscribe to 10+ podcasts; looking to discover new shows; share with friends

	 - Use cases
		 - I want to discover new shows based on my interests 

		 - I want to learn about new topics - e.g. behavioral psychology, economics

		 - I want to fill my time while doing boring chores (dishes, driving, etc.)

		 - I want to share what I'm listening to with friends / start conversations

		 - I want to find popular shows so that I can participate in cultural conversations (on social media)

		 - I want to keep up to date on people that I follow (e.g. celebrity podcasts)

	 - Solution ideas
		 - Personalized recommendations based on in-product behavioral data (listens, subscriptions, etc.)

		 - Personalized recommendations based on social media integrations (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

		 - Personalized recommendations based on geo-location (e.g. I moved to Seattle, and I get podcasts about history)

		 - Follow your friends - discover what they're subscribing to (like Spotify)

		 - Recommend individual epidosodes

		 - Show "similar podcasts" based on selected podcast

	 - Recommendation
		 - Behavioral data recs
			 - Low effort 

			 - High impact

		 - Risks
			 - Data collection and privacy (opt-in)

		 - Next steps
			 - Roll-out as beta and get feedback

- [[Mock PM Interview]] practice - Roam Research {{POMO  15}}
	 - Goals and objectives
		 - Context: tool for networked thought and note-taking

		 - Business objective: growth (global); number of new paid users

	 - Users
		 - Students: take lecture notes; review notes to study for exams; write papers

		 - Business users: take meeting notes; draft documents bullet points; note action items and tasks

		 - Personal users: journal / diary for their thoughts, etc.; agenda and todos

	 - Use cases - business users
		 - I want to quickly capture notes from meetings and discussions at work, so that I can later reference them when needed.

		 - I want to be able to quickly find references from past meetings, discussions, etc.

		 - I want to keep track of my tasks and their status

		 - I want to keep track of my priorities and goals

		 - I want to collaborate with my colleagues on tasks

		 - I want to be able to export my notes selectively (from a single meeting) to email them

		 - **I want to be able to "share" my notes so that colleagues can view them (granularly - so that they see only what I want to show them)**

		 - I want to be able to draft small notes - meeting agendas, summary of presentations or emails, etc.

		 - **I want to collaborate with my colleagues on notes drafted**

	 - Solution ideas
		 - One-click share button for individual notes (e.g. share meeting notes)

		 - Share button for tags (share all notes with a particular tag)

		 - Edit access for shared notes (optional)

		 - Enable users to view shared notes and collaborate without needing an account

		 - Voice to text transcription feature

		 - Integration with home speaker devices - Google Home, Alexa, etc.

		 - Edit note and collaborate directly in email without opening the app - email to colleague, they add bullets directly

		 - Text to voice transcription - Colleague can listen to your notes; export transcription directly to podcast feed?

	 - Summary
		 - Build feature: Email collaboration for notes
			 - Lowers barrier to entry (all business users have email)

			 - Not very costly implementation

		 - Risks
			 - Other users may not sign up for the app

		 - Next steps
			 - Customer research - observations, interviews

			 - Beta test
