- AEP Demo meeting with [[Bartek]], [[Mathieu Hannouz]], [[Anshuman Nangia]]
	 - They are generating data using experience graph generating factory

	 - Started with use case of Intelligent Services

	 - Bartek's tool is very comprehensive and flexible

- Meeting with [[Partha Dutta]] on cost
	 - AAM used snowflake; Warehouses had different names that allowed split between "data loading", "data insights", etc. Did not need to track batch vs. interactive.

	 - The databricks cost is per machine; we start up a minimum of 4 machines. This automatically scales up.

	 - Cost = VM cost + DBU cost

	 - Need to get the databricks log which will tell us how many executors per query.

	 - Partha's model
		 - Got number of nodes and times from Databricks logs

		 - Dave Sliwa should have a spreadsheet of all costs for compute gateway

	 - Batch is dedicated compute; for 10 batch requests there will be 10 DB clusters

	 - DONE We need info from compute gateway relating query ID to compute / Databricks ID. Ask [[Andrew Chen]]. Where to get DB logs? #QS-CG #Projects

- Otto engagement
	 - Scanning lots of data every day; too much usage

	 - DONE Best practice deck and enforcement of entitlement limits

	 - DONE Talk to Rezal
