		  The STO (Dmitrii Ivanovskii) is on PTO for the next two weeks, and we are seeking your support to allocate an interim STO to drive this workstream.
		  
		  Bookmark link with more context on this workstream: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18gY4ccGKov_o-cRYS_2cn1ux7mmwx2EUgxV2JJxRqyA/edit#bookmark=id.6aw0f71z1txo

		- A/B test plan for IAW LH
	- About Apurva
		- Meta for 5+ years - always in Ads Ranking
		- Dynamic ads his main focus
		- Since last year, started focusing on signal growth
	- Org structure
		- All signals org united, 3 teams
			- Signals: Brian Truong etc
			- Measurement:
			- Resilient Ad Experiences: IAB - LH, Autofill, Rewards, Lead Ads - Eng Lead Brad Boven / PM lead Deepali
		- Apurva's role
			- All ranking and delivery related areas of these products
	- LH org structure
		- PM: Jon
		- UX: IAB team - Ling
		- Signals team: Signal ingestion - Yujing
		- Ranking:
			- Mapping Pixel event to URL: Label quality
			- Using events in features and labels: Apurva (UberTL) - TL is Prateek
	- LH last half
		- Developed signal ingestion platform
		- Ranking team - built capability to infer standard events from URL; can recover 30% of pixel conversion events
			- Web conversions - 66% happen on IAB
			- 30% of this 66% can be recovered
				- Why not 100%? Because sometimes conversion doesn't change URL or it happens in iFrame
		- Used this signal as labels for model - saw .3-.4% NE over production OBA opt-out model
	- Plan for A/B testing
		- Only labels, not features (because label PXFN is easier)
		- Regular A&A QRT
		- QRT vs. CS-BQRT
			- QRT
			- BQRT: Equal budget across test + control
			- CS-BQRT: If you're intersted in a particular segment
