- ChatGPT Antonio  chat
	 - Hi Antonio! Thanks so much for engaging with my question on the prompt engineering challenge! [1] On a separate note, I notice you also responded to my chat question about langchain [2]. I did look at the note you linked, but I'm struggling with a super n00b question: how do I run "import langchain" in a Bento Notebook or accomplish something similar? Thanks in advance for any advice! 😊
