		 - Todays' journey was srange. How so? Well, it was less intense than some of my journeys. Or it lasted for less time. Maybe 15 mins or so.

		 - What did I see in the first fifteen intense minutes? I was leaving my perspective, and I was able to take on the perspective of som other objects. For a time I became a boat. 

		 - I also had the usual experience of going into the upside down world. Or the reality behind the reality. How would I describe it? It's like I'm in a graph world in 3-d. Everything has micro 3d axes to it. And it keeps swirling around.

		 - Oh, at one point I understood what it was like to channel. To have energy from outside yourself flow through you. That's the meaning of channel. It's not your energy, but it's energy that exists out there that you can control.

		 - Another analogy for my upside down world is like ma-shadar in the WoT TV show. It's like suddenly everything is consumed by a different texture.

		 - It gave me a sense of peace with other people. I saw colleagues - Aditya, and Matthew, and I was able to feel at peace with them and feel love for them.

		 - Peace and love is something it's good at.
