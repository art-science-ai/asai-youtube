		- Offline testing
			- Train model on 14 days of data; evaluate on 15th day; three runs each of baseline and proposal
			- Compare mean NE
		- Mastercook
			- Find the right combination of proposals to maximize ads score; several different runs of offline NE - only 5 versions can be tested
		- Pre-test QRT
			- General
		- Back-test
			- Individual back-test for mastercook
