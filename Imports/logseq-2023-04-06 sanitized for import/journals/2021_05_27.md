	 - [[PDF Next]]
		 - Project goal to re-invent PDF

		 - Turn PDF into HTML; embed HTML into PDF; but still backwards compatible with PDF.

		 - Second variant (which became LM): derived PDF; PDF and HTML attached to each other through structure tree.

		 - DONE Ask Randy for PDF-next documentation and use cases #[[LM-misc]]

		 - We want to create portable-HTML docs

		 - But couldn't convince users to adopt this new standard.

	 - Colorado / LM
		 - More limited ambition of above project; just about legacy documents

		 - More ambitious technically - because we have to infer the document structure rather than having creators input it.

	 - Metrics
		 - North star: Fourth from right; % LM user base entering LM

- Colorado overview with [[Steven Bruce]]
	 - [[PDF Next]]
		 - Original goal of PDF: format for printing; looks the same everywhere

		 - Container of objects; but there's no real structure to the objects - creator apps can do whatever they want.

		 - Tags are like HTML tags - e.g. H1, p, etc.

		 - Tags are standardized by the ISO PDF spec

	 - Colorado pipeline
		 - Engine that takes PDF and produces fully tagged PDF

		 - Training data is crowd-sourced; 

	 - Moving LM to on device
		 - Privacy

		 - Speed

		 - Shifting COGS from Adobe to user

	 - Docgen API
		 - Create PDFs that are LM-ready
