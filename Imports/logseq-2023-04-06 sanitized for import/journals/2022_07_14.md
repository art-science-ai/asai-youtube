- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Jen Solyanik]]
	 - About Jen
		 - Been on team for 7 years; focus on ads delivery; recently got into SL

		 - Excited by working on cutting-edge stuff - privacy preserving machine learning - dealing with very impactful problems that are top of mind for public

	 - Jen projects
		 - "basic ads" - Jen is TL - FB's offensive strategy for upcoming privacy regulations; FB is building a flexible scenario that can handle various scenarios rather than individual models for each scenario

		 - ATT de-id: we can de-id data and use it to train models
			 - We get every single event and conversion - unlike AAL

		 - Strategy for stability

	 - NM notes: 
		 - very friendly; into sci-fi

		 - Intro - self

		 - Help with planning - doc, attendance, events, social, rooms

	 - DONE Set up 1-1s with people in this call

	 - Intro
		 - Bowen's team - prime team - model performance team

		 - Prime team dinner on Weds

	 - Planning next steps
		 - Convert topics into agenda

		 - Tag required and optional people for each agenda item

	 - 

- PM camp mentorship w [[Richard Liu]]
	 - Go to MPK-15 for best cafes

		 - Smaller strategy - confined to 1-3 year timeframe, focus on end-state

		 - Focus on "understand for X"

	 - Other tips on strategy
		 - Loop in xfn partners for strategy / understand

- 1-1 [[Nick Strumpf]]
	 - Agenda
		 - Work projects Nick does

		 - SL Summit NYC

		 - Relation between CDP team vs. Core ML team?

	 - Exec vs strategy
		 - start w exec and then move on to strategy

	 - AEMv2
		 - It's an E2E product for the ad delivery stack

		 - Launched a few months ago for OBA; Launching soon for ATT

		 - It allows us to collect data in a privacy preserving manner

		 - Aggregation - lumping set of data together; bundle up to an extent that it's hard to individuate; adding more noise

	 - 2 standards for AAL
		 - De-ID: Most lenient standard (not counted in the list of 2)

		 - A&D: Aggregated and de-identified - need >5 conversions

		 - A&A: Aggregated and anonymized (more stringent standard) - need >100 conversions

	 - AEMv2 use cases
		 - AEMv2 outputs A&A datasets

		 - Users
			 - Signals team

			 - Core ML team data scientists

	 - Upstream: signals and measurement
		 - DONE PM lead: Ali Ahmadi - signals for AEM

	 - [[basic ads]] - one of our safety controls to put us in compliance with regulatory standards; strictest data control (most strict of tiered framework - more stringent than AAL etc.)
