	 - Journal
		 - I'm about forty minutes into my journeyj, and the effects are jus starting to wear off. I can still keep going a bit if I focus on the msuic. I  am writing this while doing that how?

		 - What did I feel in the journey? A lot of love. A cricle of love. The overwhelming emotion I felt was love. I have so much love that I want to share with Rukma and with everyone else in my life. I want to express love and kindl kindness. T\hat is the purpose of life. What more could I add value in theis world better than embodying love?

		 - Wahat did I see? In the beginning there were visions of me doing things in the godswood - with Rukm and with friends - there were our guests from the wedding party -  JV, Aaron, their partners, everyone else. I felt so much love for them all

		 - I had the usual starting point where I dissociate from myself and see myself as another person who is in need of love.

		 - Do I use drugs too much? For me drugs are a way to build connection with people. Except ketamine and psychedelics. They help me become the kind of person who wants to build more connection with people.
