		- Hi NAME - I'm currently working to understand what conversion signals we get from each 1PD bet and what value that contributes to Ads Ranking. [1]
		  
		  *Can you share any docs to help me better understand what data / signals we get from this 1PD bet?*
		  
		  Something like a canonical doc would also be super helpful for me to better understand the product milestones and timelines. Thanks!

		- Hi NAME, hope you're doing well! 😊 
		  
		  I'm reaching out to you because you're listed as the QB for the 1PD HVR bet - NAME [1]. I'm the PM on Ads Delivery side for 1PD HVR, and I'm currently working to understand what conversion signals we get from each 1PD bet and what value that contributes to Ads Ranking [2].
		  
		  *Can you share any docs to help me better understand what data / signals we get from this 1PD bet in the short-term and long-term?* 
		  
		  Something like a canonical doc would also be super helpful for me to better understand the product milestones and timelines. Alternatively, can you point me to the right person for this request? Thanks very much in advance!
