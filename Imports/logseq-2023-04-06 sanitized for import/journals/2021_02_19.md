- LASA meeting with [[Kevin Foster]], [[Rahul Radhakrishnan], [[PK]]], [[Iones Walter]]
	 - DONE slack channel for lasa

	 - Intro: Kevin and me
		 - 3 issues: orchestration, stability, and performance

		 - orchestration: roadmap

		 - stability: solved (per KF)

		 - performance: not much more improvements we can eke out

	 - Orchestration and performance issues are orthogonal.

	 - Issue: lag between query submission and execution
		 - 5 min gap is expected - time taken to launch cluster; necessary for batch jobs (not interactive)

		 - New feature: blocks - allows us to run multiple API calls in single block

	 - Issue: some queries in progress for several hours
		 - It is a status issue; query actually completed, but status did not update

	 - QS architecture
		 - 32-cores per node

	 - AA customers - requirements
		 - CJA can egress processed datasets to Data Lake

		 - In Platform, customers can choose their own Attribution

		 - Can you own this in the CA?

	 - Jackie's role
		 - This year goal: migrate DMP capabilities to AEP

	 - Data feeds
		 - Event based log - event data in AAM is "segment realizations"

		 - Customers use it to create better reporting outside AAM; connect it with Query tools, etc. Similar to AA feeds.

	 - Current state of platform
		 - Customers can pull segment realizations - ability to subscribe to segment realization events

	 - AAM connector
		 - Only works for segments that are already created
