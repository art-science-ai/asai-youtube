			- Two modes of shopping
				- Browsing as entertainment - scrolling through feed and looking at ads
				- Looking for something specific - goes to Google
			- Dynamic carousel ads interaction
				- Boots example - same company multiple boots
				- If she really wants a suede boots she'll search on Google; Google search has multi-advertiser dynamic ads which she really likes; whereas IG is only single advertiser
				- What if one of the tiles in the dynamic ads - takes you into an experience - dive deeper
				- Intelligent prompts that let you articulate what you want to see
					- E.g. show more formal styles
					- Pre-built prompts + things you type in (like SFV idea)
				-
