- 1-1 w [[Sagar Pilania]]
	 - xfn - start w other 

	 - ramp project for me
		 - Start with not super ambiguous project - more execution focused - learn about stack

	 - Two major signal loss events
		 - Apple ATT signal loss

		 - OBA signal loss 
			 - Meta internal stricter interpretation of OBA / 3P data sharing

			 - GDPR makes this control as a popup in FB / Insta apps

			 - Even before GDPR, we didn't use this data for features or for targeting, but we did use this data as label for training ML model; also used it for experimentation

	 - Segments of signal loss people
		 - OBA opt-out

		 - ATT opt-out

		 - Both opt-out

	 - ATT mitigation
		 - transfer learning on opt-in users, then de-bias and transfer to opt-out group

	 - OBA mitigation
		 - did not deploy transfer learning yet

		 - Currently don't have any PM / TPM support - can start

	 - PSC expectations
		 - Strategy / execution / capacity - 40/40/20

		 - Exec - oba mitigation should be sufficient

		 - Strat - future opportunities around signal loss / I can also self-identify
