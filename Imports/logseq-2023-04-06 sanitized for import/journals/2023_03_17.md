		 - There are two ways to use OpenAI models
			 - OpenAI API (includes all OpenAI models)

			 - Azure API (does not include gpt-4 - only includes older models)

		 - Meta has an account for Azure API but not for OpenAI API

		 - My hackathon team would like to use GPT-4 if possible. GPT-4 access is currently behind a waitlist and I'm the only person in the team who got through the waitlist (just got through today)

	 - Ask
		 - Can I use my GPT-4 account for this hackathon and submit the OpenAI API bill via concur for reimbursement?

		 - We could set a cost-cap (say $200) and cut

	 - Hi Nithya! Based on our estimation, this effort requires HC investment from multiple teams:

3 eng 2 months (Signals) + 

1 eng 1 month (Ads infra) + 

2 eng 2 months (Delivery/Ranking)

= ~ 6 eng 2 months total

Sagar - could you help identify the right POCs for each of these areas?
