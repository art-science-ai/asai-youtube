- Appointment [[One Medical]] w [[Saya Akkad]]
	 - Metrics review
		 - NMR LipoProfile+Lipids
			 - LDL-C most important; high at 105; last test showed 134, so this is a big improvement; ideally closer to 70

			 - LDL-P and small LDL-P
				 - But how many actual particles do I have floating through my bloodstream?
					 - Each particle is like a ball and playing dodgeball against blood vessels - causes inflammation and plaque formation

					 - LDL-P tells us this metric; high at 1393

				 - But what kind of balls are they? Soft and fluffy, or hard and dense? Latter is more harmful
					 - Small LDL-P; low at 434; but I want to get to the ~ 100 range

				 - Don't have history on these metrics

			 - LD-IR
				 - I'm high at 40; threshold is 45; lowest is 25

				 - IR is likely the driver for cholestorol and also for other things like Alzhimers

		 - Glucose nad other metrics
			 - Glucose trending upwards - now 97 - threshold is 100; Trend is BAD!

			 - Insulin is 4.8 - not bad - but should be lower

		 - Thyroid
			 - Overall looks fine - T3 is good but T4 is a bit high; not too concerned

			 - Thyroglobulin Antibody - high at 1.5; marker of general inflammation; could be from IR; could be from vaping

		 - C-Reactive Protein, Cardiac
			 - Not too high, but higher than usual for my age; doc expected <1

			 - Marker of inflammation

	 - Overall summary
		 - Inflammation in general

	 - Recommendations
		 - Focus on IR, and that will help the cholesterol; how? reduce glucose spikes

		 - STOP vaping

	 - Questions
		 - How often to re-test?
