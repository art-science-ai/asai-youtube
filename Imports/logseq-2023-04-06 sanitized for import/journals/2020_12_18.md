	 - Criteria for analyzing an algorithm
		 - Primary criteria: Time and Space
			 - Time complexity = Number of steps

			 - Space complexity = number of words

		 - Secondary: Network, power, etc.

	 - Frequency count method
		 - Count how many times each line is executed and add up

		 - Unravel the loop if you don't know how many times it will execute
