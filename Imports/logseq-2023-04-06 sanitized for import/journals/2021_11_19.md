	 - DONE Analytics issues to fix on Monday
		 - Hi team — Based on my review with Pallav and Laurie, I've logged three blocker issues for the November release:
			 - DCMAA-38024: Conversion pipeline and user preference evars should not be updated during a pipeline run; updates should happen at doc close

			 - 

		 - Pallav, Laurie — Could you please review

		 - 

		 - All evars related to pipeline should be set at the beginnig of a transacgtion, otherwise default to whatever was last set - show dashboard; don't change while doc is open

		 - NONE should not be logged ever for new file

		 - Failure - unknown abandon

	 - DONE Invite pallav to monday meeting

- DONE Auto-open announcements #[[LM-Mobile]] #2021-W47 [[November 23rd, 2021]] [[November 24th, 2021]]
	 - Subject: Liquid Mode crosses 50M monthly files read as Android auto-open scales up to 100%

	 - I'm extremely excited to announce that Liquid Mode has crossed 50M monthly files read in November '21. Below is a snapshot of monthly files read in FY'21.

	 - Summary: Liquid Mode auto-open eligibility has been rolled out to 100% of Android wave 1 users, i.e., nearly 20M monthly active mobile users with high LM usage.

	 - Impact: 
		 - Increases files

		 - Reduces prompts

		 - No impact on tools or monetization

	 - Next steps: 
		 - Expanding auto-open on iOS

		 - Expanding to signed out users

		 - Expanding to medium LM usage segment

	 - Acknowledgements:
