- [[Ads Core ML onboarding]] - reading

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Wei Wu]]
	 - About Wei
		 - CS at college - Ops Research at Columbia - JP Morgan 

	 - About work
		 - Signal loss mitigation

		 - In future - some personal data, some data will be protected, and it's our job to build ML solutions within those constraints

	 - About Wei's role
		 - TL for model iteration - another TL focuses on research; Wei cares more about model, how to productionalize, how to stabilize, make dev process 

	 - Models
		 - Web 1 day click through off site conversion models
			 - Wei's team focuses on this

			 - Short term prediction of behavior

		 - Another team called CDP team - which focuses on attribution, etc.

	 - OBA mitigation
		 - Approaches
			 - Transfer learning - from OBA opt-in to OBA opt-out
				 - TL: xiaoyuan zhu

			 - Feature mitigation from on-site signals
				 - mingrui wu and shuai liu - onsite signals

			 - Anonymized & Aggregated learning - Zhonghua Qu

	 - What Wei cares about
		 - Model quality

		 - Revenue stability

	 - Challenges
		 - Uncertainties and stability of infra - like AEMv2

	 - Who else to meet
		 - Fan Yuan - STO for OBA mitigation; above Wei

		 - Damien - STO for overall signal loss - above Fan

		 - Yuhui Ouyang (Parental Leave) - delivery system

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Srikar Kasinadhuni Prasad]]
	 - Srikar stood me up

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Spencer Rothwell]]
	 - About Spencer
		 - TPM for 8 years - focused on ML / NLP

	 - Work
		 - Owns AAL - Aggregated and anonymized learning

		 - Saeid owns Ads score - metric for how good ads are

		 - Under Saied Spencer will own Signal Loss part of ads score

	 - OBA mitigation
		 - Spencer is not clear on what we're doing about it.

		 - 

	 - AAL
		 - By end of year we want to have A&A model in production

		 - Teams: training and modeling

	 - Misc
		 - DONE Send workchat desktop app

		 - Taking paternity leave for 4 months

- [[Intro 1-1]] w [[Fan Yuan]]
	 - NM thoughts
		 - Very friendly guy - I'll like working with him

	 - About Fan
		 - Bellevue; Has two kids; wife is DS at Google

		 - Meta for 3 yrs; whole time in this team; 

		 - Before Meta at Amazon - research scientist, optimization of routes; also capacity plannig optimization; building all the algos and ML models

		 - Junbiao reached out to him for a coffee chat and recruited him (similar to how Sagar recruited me)

	 - Fan's work
		 - Works on SL; started w ATT opt-out; then OBA; now main focus is AEMv2

		 - ATT mitigation: Recovered 50% of loss; at best we can mitigate 80%

		 - AEMv2 - Aggregate Event Management v2: in-house data solution for SL mitigation; moving away from user-level 3PD to aggregate 3PD
			 - PM leads: Ali, Nitin, etc. - large team

		 - OBA - delegated to Yuhui; Fan covering until mid-August

	 - Advice for me
		 - Another meeting with
