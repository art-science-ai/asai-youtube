			 - Hi Maryam, hope you're doing well! 😊 I'm a PM on Sagar's Core ML team focusing on Signal Growth Ads Ranking. I have a background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I'm interested in learning more about Generative AI / NLP use cases for Ads, and Sagar asked me to reach out to you to learn more about the opportunities you're currently exploring in this space.

ASK: Could you please share any docs or posts on GenAI / NLP use cases you are exploring, or point me to the right person for this request?

Thanks very much in advance!
