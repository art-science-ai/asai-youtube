		 - Happy birthday Piyush! Glad I still have you in my life as one of my oldest friends, and I'm so happy that our friendship has grown into a friendship between two families now! ❤️

		 - Sorry for the belated message - I was a bit unwell yesterday

		 - On that note, heads up that I've had a sore throat since 1-2 days. The doctor diagnosed it as most likely strep throat and I started taking antibiotics yesterday. Apparently I'm no longer contagious 24 hours after starting antibiotics, but please make an informed decision about whether you still want to come over tomorrow evening. We're also not going anywhere this weekend (due to the rains), so postponing is another option.
