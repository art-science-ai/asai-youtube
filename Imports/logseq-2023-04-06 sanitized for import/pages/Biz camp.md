		 - Matching ad demand (advertisers) and ad supply to optimize for value for advertisers and users.

		 - Auction: total bid = advertiser value + correction factors
			 - advertiser value = paced bid * likelihood (conversion | impression)
				 - paced bid = maxes out at profit per sale, then Meta paces it out over time

				 - likelihood: measured by Meta's ML models

			 - correction factors aka organic bid
				 - Repitition penalty

				 - Misleading experiences penalty

				 - Report over hide penalty - highly reported ads are bad

		 - How much we charge advertisers
			 - They pay the second price value of total bid

			 - Second price auction aligns incentives; otherwise advertisers would keep lowering their maximum bid until they get to the second price

		 - Machine learning
			 - Almost 50% of value is created through ML

			 - Most ads ranking models use neural networks

			 - Input is features, and output / label is likelihood of user clicking on ad

		 - Journey of an ad
			 - Ads manager / 3p ads tools > ads API . AdmarketDB > Ad Publisher > in memory storage > 

			 - User client makes ad request using Ad request API
