	 - Docs - nikhil
		 - **☐  IRS income tax return transcript for most recent tax year. **A “tax transcript” is the official IRS record of your income tax filing. The transcript may be requested at no charge from the IRS online at https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. The IRS website sometimes experiences service disruptions, so you can also request the transcript using the Form 4506-T (available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf). **Note:**Your U.S. family member petitioner will need to provide copies of his or her tax transcripts for use with the Form I-864, Affidavit of Support. If you and your sponsor filed jointly in the most recent tax year there is no need to provide multiple copies of your returns.

		 - **☐  Evidence of non-taxed income. **The Form I-944 offers the option of reporting non-taxed income as “additional income” that you have earned. An example of income not subject to U.S. taxation would be certain foreign income. For IRS guidance on non-taxed income see [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/ p525.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/%20p525.pdf). If we will be relying on non-taxed income for your Form I-944 you will need to provide documentation of the income. For example, for foreign income, we can provide a copy of your tax returns from the foreign country. ****

		 - **☐  Assets and resources. **The Form I-944 asks for us to report all of your assets that can be converted into U.S. cash within 12 months. Note that for this item we are allowed to provide information about both your assts __and__ the** **assets of any household** **member (such as your sponsor).
			 - **☐  **__Checking and savings accounts__. We are required to provide the past 12 months of account statements.

			 - **☐  **__Annuities__. Provide a current statement for your annuity.

			 - **☐  **__Stocks, bonds and certificates of deposit__. Provide a current statement from your investment account.

			 - **☐  **__Net cash value of real estate holdings__. The present value of real estate is ideally established by a formal appraisal. We must also provide a statement showing the balance of any loan mortgaged against the real estate in order to establish the “net” value of the property.

			 - **☐  **__Any other “substantial assets__.” In most cases the categories above will be the only assets that we rely upon. In rare cases you may have additional assets that can be listed, such as farm equipment. In such a situation we would need to provide a valuation of the assets.

			 - DONE **☐  Liabilities and debts. **We are required to report and document __all__ of your debts and liabilities. This includes student loans, home loans (“mortgages”), consumer/credit card debt, car loans, child/spousal support, etc. Each liability or debt will need to be documented, normally with a statement from the loan issuer.

		 - **☐  Credit score. **We are required to report your current U.S. credit score and provide the associated report. You can obtain a free credit report once a year under the Fair Credit Reporting Act from each one of the three credit reporting agencies. You are only required to provide one credit report from any of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. See https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports for more information. If there are any errors in the credit report, you should provide evidence from the credit reporting agency that demonstrates that you reported the error and that the error is under investigation or has been resolved.
			 - If you have any **negative history** in your credit report, you may provide an explanation in the designated area of this form. Negative credit history may include delinquent accounts, debt collections, charge-offs (delinquent accounts deemed unlikely to be collected), repossession, foreclosure, judgments, tax liens, or bankruptcy on your credit report.

			 - If you **do not have a credit report** or credit score, provide documentation that demonstrates that you do not have a credit report or score with a credit bureau. You may provide evidence of continued payment of bills if there is no credit report or credit score.

		 - DONE **☐  Bankruptcy. **If you** **have ever filed for bankruptcy we most document how the bankruptcy was resolved. Generally, this will be an order of discharge. If you do not have a copy of your bankruptcy file, please talk to your lawyer. Normally we will be able to acquire the file electronically from the federal bankruptcy court.

		 - **☐  Current health insurance. **If you** **have health insurance we are required to provide __one__ of the following. __A health insurance card is not sufficient documentation of coverage. __
			 - 1. For each policy, a copy of each policy page showing the terms and type of coverage and individuals covered (normally this will be the easiest for you to provide); or

			 - 2. Letter on the company letter head or other evidence from your health insurance company stating you are currently enrolled in health insurance and providing the terms and type of coverage; or

			 - 3. The latest Form 1095-B, Health Coverage; Form 1095-C, Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage (if available) with evidence of renewal of coverage for the current year.

We will need to provide a letter or other evidence from the insurance company showing that you have enrolled in or have a future enrollment date for a health insurance plan. The letter or other evidence must include the terms, the type of coverage, that you are the individual covered, and the date when the coverage begins.

		 - DONE **☐  Public benefits. **If you have ever received public benefits in the United States,** **please contact your attorney immediately to discuss this issue. Receipt of public benefits may disqualify you from proceeding with your case. If the public benefit is not disqualifying then we will need to provide documentation of the benefit you received.
			 - Examples of public benefits include the following: Any Federal, State, local, or tribal cash assistance for income maintenance; 2. Supplemental Security Income (SSI); 3. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); 4. Federal, State or local cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called “General Assistance” in the State context, but which may exist under other names); 5.

Each of the following is required for each individual for whom you serve as primary caregiver:
			 - **☐  **__Documentation that you are the caregiver__. For minor children, normally a birth certificate will suffice for this purpose. For adopted children, please provide a copy of the order of adoption. If you are caring for a parent or other adult please contact your attorney to discuss how we can best document this fact.

			 - **☐  **__Proof of residence__. We must show that the individual you are caring for resides at your address. This is normally best accomplished with a copy of a medical or school record listing your home address.

			 - **☐  **__Age and medical condition__. In addition to the individual’s birth certificate, we must provide documentation of any medical condition that requires your care. For practical purposes, medical documentation will normally be required only for adults under your care or for children requiring special medical addition on a daily basis.

		 - **☐ Educational degrees & trade certificates. **We must document all of your educational degrees from high school upwards. Likewise, if you have earned trade certifications, those must be documented as well. Please note that we do not have to document minor educational certificates.

			 - **☐  Diploma and transcript.** We are asked to provide the diploma __and __official transcript for each of your educational programs, high school and higher. The transcript should be in certified form, provided by the educational institution.

If you prefer, your attorney can obtain an equivalency certification on your behalf.
