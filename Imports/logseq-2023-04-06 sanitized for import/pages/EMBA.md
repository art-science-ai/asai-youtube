				 - Below is a description of my ethical case and why I chose this topic for this week's assignment:

"The company: HealthAI is a startup company in the health and wellness space providing personalized fitness and nutrition plans to customers. 

The problem that the company is solving: Customers today are overwhelmed with a plethora of fitness and nutrition plans they can follow, but they don't know which one is right for them. Should they lift weights or should they do bodyweight exercises? Should they follow a low-carb diet or a low calorie diet? The possibilities are endless. Personalized recommendations are traditionally very expensive, because one needs to hire an expensive coach or consultant. 

The product: HealthAI uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze customers' personal data (either through user inputs, or through smartwatch and smartphone integration) to come up with a personalized recommendation for the customer regarding which nutrition plan and which fitness plan they should follow.

About the company: The company is a small startup company with a small team of five engineers, one product manager, and one CEO.

The ethical dilemma: Customers have uploaded lots of personal data into HealthAI's platform in order to get personalized recommendations. Now the CEO wants to use customers' data not only to personalize individual customer plans based on that customers data, but he wants to use customer data to improve the overall recommendation engine and make recommendations to other customers. It's not clear whether the customers have explicitly consented to their data being used in this manner. What should the Product Manager do?

Why I chose this case: I work as a Product Manager in the machine learning and artificial intelligence space. As such, my work involves building prediction models based on customer data. Therefore, I constructed this hypothetical case to think more deeply about the ethical concerns that arise out of using customer data in this manner." (Maddirala, 2020)

				 - According to the text's suggested framework for ethical decision making, Madison must first carefully evaluate the various factors that are influencing this situation, primarily including: (1) Individual factors, (2) Organizational factors, and (3) Industry level factors. Let us look at how each of these factors can inform her course of action.

				 - (1) Individual factors. Madison should try to better understand what individual factors may be impacting Jim's behavior here. Could it be an issue of communication style? Could there be factors outside of work that are impacting Jim? What is Jim's own personal system of morals and values? An understanding of these issues will enable Madison to better engage with Jim in conversation.

				 - (2) Organizational factors: Next, Madison should try to understand what organizational factors are at play. How does the company empower managers vs. salespeople? What's the company's attitude towards men vs. women? What kind of corporate culture is the norm here? An understanding of these issues will help Madison understand how she can talk to people other than Jim at her organization (e.g. Jim's manager or someone above that).

				 - (3) Industry level factors: Lastly, Madison should try to understand if there is a broader culture in the oil industry as a whole that is driving the behavior of Jim and the organization. For example, investment banking culture is known to be very male-dominated and competitive. This will help her determine whether this industry is the right fit for her or if she should seek employment opportunities in some other industry.

				 - Overall, it's a horrible situation for Madison to be in, and this shouldn't be happening to her, but given this situation, the above factors will help her determine her next course of action.

			 - Prompt
				 - When difficult ethical decisions need to be made in an organization, our text suggests several approaches and models. In the chapter 5 business challenge scenario, how might employee Madison work through her decision on how to handle her ethical dilemma? If Madison cannot report her problems to her immediate supervisor, what are some other ways she can handle the situation?

					 - Summary: To what extent should HealthAI use their customers' personal data to improve their product?

					 - The company: HealthAI is a startup company in the health and wellness space providing personalized fitness and nutrition plans to customers. 

					 - The problem that the company is solving: Customers today are overwhelmed with a plethora of fitness and nutrition plans they can follow, but they don't know which one is right for them. Should they lift weights or should they do bodyweight exercises? Should they follow a low-carb diet or a low calorie diet? The possibilities are endless. Personalized recommendations are traditionally very expensive, because one needs to hire an expensive coach or consultant.  

					 - The product: HealthAI uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze customers' personal data (either through user inputs, or through smartwatch and smartphone integration) to come up with a personalized recommendation for the customer regarding which nutrition plan and which fitness plan they should follow.

					 - About the company: The company is a small startup company with a small team of five engineers, one product manager, and one CEO.

					 - The ethical dilemma: Customers have uploaded lots of personal data into HealthAI's platform in order to get personalized recommendations. Now the CEO wants to use customers' data not only to personalize individual customer plans based on that customers data, but he wants to use customer data to improve the overall recommendation engine and make recommendations to other customers. It's not clear whether the customers have explicitly consented to their data being used in this manner. What should the Product Manager do?

					 - Why I chose this case: I work as a Product Manager in the machine learning and artificial intelligence space. As such, my work involves building prediction models based on customer data. Therefore, I constructed this hypothetical case to think more deeply about the ethical concerns that arise out of using customer data in this manner.

			 - Prompt

			 - What was the focus of the course work this week?
				 - Ethical Decision Making

			 - What were the topics?
				 - In this week's coursework, I learned about a suggested framework and model for ethical decision making. According to this framework we must consider several factors in ethical decision making, including: (1) Individual factors, (2) Organizational factors, and (3) Industry level factors. I analyzed a case study considering each of these factors in detail.

			 - How does it relate to your work? 
				 - As a Product Manager for Adobe Experience Platform, I enable my customers (marketing professionals) to use my product to perform various marketing operations. As such my customers are very concerned about ensuring that their use of the platform (and their use of customer data) is in line with their values, compliance regulations, and ethics. Therefore, it is very helpful for me to learn about such ethical frameworks in order to better help my customers meet their goals.

				 - We know from the text that "There are five power bases from which a leader may influence ethical behavior: reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, expert power, and referent power." In this case, it seems that Britney is making use of "coercive power", because she is giving Candace an ultimatum, by telling Candace that either she needs to implicate the other managers in question, or she will be seen as part of the problem. It is worth noting that while the tactics being used by Britney are questionable (the use of coercive power should be avoided), but the ends towards which she is working seem laudable (she is trying to make the workplace more meritocratic by removing favoritism).

What should Candace do in this situation? She should be as honest and objective as possible. First of all, she shouldn't have made the kind of allegation that she did without specific evidence. But now that she has already made the allegation, she should provide as much objective evidence as possible to Britney. Provide details such as a history of promotions within the organization, and a detailed assessment of the quality of work produced by the person who was promoted vs. other people who were passed over for promotions. The more detail she can provide, the better it will be for her, because she is enabling Britney to make a more informed, objective decision. 

			 - Prompt
				 - Leaders have a strong influence on the culture of an organization or department. In chapter 7 of our main text our business challenge speaks to some of these factors. Based on the case, What type of leadership power is Britney seeking to leverage? Is it effective? What recommendations would you have for Candace in this situation?

				 - According to the case description, Saul seems pretty convinced that Robert is guilty of fraud. While there doesn't seem to be hard evidence at the moment, Saul should definitely investigate further. For the purposes of this discussion, I will assume that Saul has completed his investigation and has in fact found conclusive proof of the fact that Robert is engaged in Medicaid fraud. Now Saul must decide between turning Robert in to the authorities or keeping quiet. In this case, there are three competing motivations that Saul needs to work through. Saul's primary stakeholders are (1) Saul himeslf, (2) Saul's brother and family, and (3) society at large. From the point of view of (3) society at large, Saul should probably report the fraud and turn his brother in, because society would be better of if such crimes were punished. From the point of view of (2) Saul's brother and family, he should probably keep quiet and protect his brother. From the point of view of (1) himself, he needs to weigh the two consequences against each other and decide which is more important to him. Moral philosophy doesn't have an objective answer to this question, because it depends on which system of ethics we chose. What is a higher principle - always report fraud? Or always put family first? This is a tough dilemma with no easy answer.

			 - Prompt
				 - Lack of accountability can lead people to make ethical mistakes. Based on the business challenge scenario in Chapter 6, how would you describe Saul’s dilemma and how would you recommend he handle the situation?

id:: 2981f2c3-d0e1-44bc-8cbf-f4f60a04b297
					 - • Identify the parties involved, their rights, their responsibilities
						 - Customers: 
							 - Who they are: The customers are basically the entire group of people that has ever downloaded and used the HealthAI application. Customers are perhaps the most important stakeholders of all. 

							 - What their rights are: Customers have the right to use or not use the application as they desire. They also have the right to reasonable respect of their data privacy. 

							 - What their responsibilities are: Customers do not have any responsibilities other than complying with the terms of service of the application they are using.

						 - Product Manager
							 - Who they are: The Product Manager at HealthAI. Currently it is just one individual, but eventually may grow into an entire team of product managers as the product grows.

							 - What their rights are: Just as any other employee, the product manager is free to leave the organization when they desire.

							 - What their responsibilities are: As an employee, the product manager is responsible for the tasks assigned to him by his manager (in this case the CEO). The product manager is also responsible for bridging the gap between customers and engineers. He is responsible for conveying the customer's feedback to the engineers and shaping the future direction of the product.

						 - Engineering team
							 - Who they are: They are the engineering team of HealthAI who write the code for the application.

							 - What their rights are: Like any employee, they are free to leave the company or quit their job whenever they wish. They have the right to say no to any request to modify the application (but then they risk getting fired).

							 - What their responsibilities are: They are responsible for completing the tasks that are assigned to them by their manager (and ultimately, from the CEO). They are also responsible for creating a functional product to serve customer needs.

						 - CEO
							 - Who they are: The CEO of HealthAI.

							 - What their rights are: The CEO has the right to hire and fire employees at his discretion. If he feels that employees are not serving the best interests of the company, he can let them go and hire new employees.

							 - What their responsibilities are: The CEO is responsible to the board of directors (and ultimately to the owners / investors). Moreover, the CEO is also responsible to the various stakeholders of the business such as customers and employees.

						 - Board of directors
							 - Who they are: They represent the owners and investors of the company as well as other stakeholders.

							 - What their rights are: They have the right to oversee the CEO, to fire the CEO if he does not execute properly, and they can hire a new CEO.

							 - What their responsibilities are: They are responsible for looking out for the interests of the company's investors and owners as well as the other stakeholders.

					 - • Identify the salient ethical and/or legal issues of the case
						 - Legal issues: The primary legal issue here concerns whether or not the company has the right to use their customers' data to improve their recommendation engine. This depends on the general data and privacy rights as dictated by the laws of the country or countries in which the customers are located (e.g. GDPR), and it also depends on the terms of service (TOS) and the End User License Agreement (EULA) that was entered into between the customers and HealthAI. In this case, HealthAI explicitly made sure to include language in the EULA and TOS that gives them the right to use customer data to improve their algorithms. However, it is not clear whether or not most customers actually understood what they were consenting to when they signed the agreement (or checked the box). Moreover, it is not clear whether such data usage is consistent with the laws of the countries in which HealthAI operates (primarily US and EU).

						 - Ethical issues: The ethical issue is related to the legal issue, but it goes even beyond the legal issue. Even if we suppose that HealthAI is within their legal rights to make use of customer data in this manner, it is not clear whether or not it is ethical for them to do so. This is especially compounded by the fact that customers do not seem to have a clear understanding of what they agreed to when they checked the box confirming that they agree to the EULA and TOS. When the Product Manager started having discussions with the customers, he came to understand that most customers were not aware that HealthAI was using their personal data to improve the algorithms which make personalized recommendations to other users.

					 - • Identify the relevant factual issues, conceptual issues, social constraints, and any additional information necessary for an accurate understanding of the case.
						 - The use of the HealthAI application is completely voluntary: All users are using the HealthAI application of their own volition. No users are required to use this application by their companies or by any other organization or any other compulsion.

						 - The use of customer data to improve the recommendation engine leads to a significant improvement in the quality of recommendations that the HealthAI application can generate, which in turn leads to an improved user experience for new and returning users, which in turn leads to improved revenues and profitability for the company.

						 - Customers seem to be unaware of what they have consented to in terms of their personal data usage, and when they become aware of this, they are largely uncomfortable with the way in which their data is being used.

					 - • If needed, conduct research about the issue from multiple perspectives and include relevant ethical theory, legal requirements, and technical details about the case to ensure that the case can be solved.
						 - One perspective is that HealthAI's behavior is not problematic. According to an article by the Baylor Business Review, HealthAI's practice would be fine if they were honest from the beginning: "Online collection of data works well if companies are honest from the start" (__Baylor Business Review » Ethics of Collecting Customer Data__, 2012).

						 - However, according to another perspective, even if HealthAI was honest from the beginning, their use of customer data is still problematic. According to a Harvard Business Review article, HealthAI's behavior would pose an ethical concern due to the unintended and uncontemplated use of customer data (from the customer's perspective): "Although the customer, at least tacitly, consented to the collection, use, and transfer of her purchase data, the real issue here is the unintended and uncontemplated use of the information (from the customer’s point of view). Most customers would probably be quite surprised to learn that their personal information could be used by companies in a wholly unrelated industry and in other ways that aren’t readily foreseeable."

			 - What was the focus of the course work this week?
				 - Factors in Ethical Decision Making

			 - What were the topics?
				 - In this week's coursework, I learned about the individual factors and the organizational factors that affect ethical decision making. In terms of individual factors, I learned about the various moral philosophies and values that individuals may have and how those impact ethical decision making. Then in terms of organizational factors, I learned about the role of ethical culture and relationships and how those factors impact ethical decision making. I studied case studies on each of these topics and I worked on developing my own case study related to data privacy.

			 - How does it relate to your work? 
				 - As a Product Manager for Adobe Experience Platform, I need to be keenly aware of data privacy concerns and issues related to the ethical use of customer data, because my customers (i.e. marketers who use Adobe Experience Platform) are deeply concerned with these issues. In fact, one of the projects I am currently working on is about governance and privacy for customer data on our platform. Therefore, thinking through this case study is a very valuable exercise for me.

				 - In this week's simulation (specifically, in "Assignment: Chapter 08: Ethical Decisions"), the first question presented a very surprising situation. A manager from a competitor firm is interviewing for a job, and you are told that he "doesn't quite fit" and moreover, you are told that he is offering to divulge the competitive strategy of his former employer (i.e. the competitor). This seems like an unethical individual, and there is no guarantee that he will not go to another competitor in the near future and offer to divulge your own competitive strategy. It seems like the best decision in this case would be to not hire this individual. However, the case only presents us with two choices: "Hire him and get the information" or "Hire him but don't get the information." In reality, the best choice would be to not hire such an individual, but given the choices presented by the case, the best choice is to hire him and not to get the information. I think it is always a bad idea to hire individuals who display a lack of integrity with respect to their former employers, because one day they will move on and you will be their former employer, and at that point, it is very likely that this employee will display a lack of integrity towards you too.

				 - __What alternatives and responsibilities does Mary have as a representative for both the buyer and seller in this hypothetical deal?__ As the representative of the seller (Ted), Mary is responsible for ensuring that Ted gets a fair price for his property and that he is not getting less than what it is truly worth. As the representative of the buyer (Smith), Mary is responsible for ensuring that Smith pays a fair price for this property and that he is not paying more than what it is truly worth. Moreover, Mary is responsible for brokering the communication between the two parties in a manner that is fair, transparent, and honest.

				 - How would you handle things if you were the seller Ted and later found out the firm was not completely truthful with you? A lot would depend on the eventual outcome of the transaction. It is not clear whether or not Smith can even raise the full funds needed to complete the purchase. If Smith raised the full funds, and I got $950,000 from the sale, I would consider that a good outcome, since it's only $50,000 below my asking price. However, I would certainly be upset with JSYK for misleading me and being dishonest.

				 - In what ways might a comprehensive compliance code help JSKY company avoid ethical problems? A code of ethics would help facilitate an informed conversation between Mary and her boss George. In this case her response to George is that "it doesn't feel honest." This is probably not a compelling argument for George, because he might not care so much about how Mary feels. However, if there was a code of ethics, then Mary could say "this violates our code of ethics, therefore we shouldn't do this." This would be a much more powerful argument.

				 - Part 2: Critically analyze the case (3-4 pages):
id:: 51162d75-419e-4169-8060-bc96b01248ab
					 - • Identify the primary “ethical dilemma (or question)” in the case.
						 - The situation is as follows: "Customers have uploaded lots of personal data into HealthAI's platform in order to get personalized recommendations. Now the CEO wants to use customers' data not only to personalize individual customer plans based on that customers data, but he wants to use customer data to improve the overall recommendation engine and make recommendations to other customers. It's not clear whether the customers have explicitly consented to their data being used in this manner. What should the Product Manager do?" (Maddirala, 2020)

						 - Now the ethical dilemma or question concerns what the Product Manager chooses to do. Should the Product Manager go ahead and start implementing the feature requested by the CEO or not? On the one hand the Product Manager is responsible for his customers as his stakeholders and for keeping their best interests at heart. Whereas on the other hand the Product Manager is responsible to his CEO and has a duty to execute the tasks given to him by the CEO. The Product Manager should also consider his own standards of ethics and morals. So what should he do in this situation?

					 - • Formulate possible courses of action.
						 - The Product Manager's main courses of action are as follows: 

						 - (1) **Submit to the CEO**: The Product Manager can listen to his CEO and implement the requested recommendation feature based on customers' personal data.

						 - (2) **Defy the CEO**: The Product Manager can refuse to listen to his CEO and safeguard the personal data of his customers.

						 - (3) **Negotiate with the CEO**: The Product manager can negotiate with the CEO and get him to change his mind about this feature request by presenting the voice of the customer.

					 - • Discuss any role that information technology or context played in creating the special circumstances of the case.
						 - This entire scenario would not exist outside the context of modern information technology in the age of big data and artificial intelligence. In fact, even a decade or two ago, this would not have been a dilemma that Product Managers would face. Today, all companies want to get on the AI bandwagon and start harvesting customer data to make their company more intelligent. According to a report by Adobe, "AI augmentation will generate $2.9 trillion in business value and recover 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity" (__Artificial Intelligence Unlocks The True Power Of Analytics__, 2020).

						 - It is only when we reach a certain level of scale with respect to the possibilities of big data and AI that such ethical dilemmas can arise. As suggested by an HBR article the rise of decision making based on big data and AI can pose a hazard to customers and to organizations: "Decisions that might be made on the basis of the shared data represent another hazard for consumers—and for organizations" (__The Dark Side of Customer Analytics__, 2014)

					 - • Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of those actions. Analyze different courses of action. Are these courses of action ethical? Weigh the pros and cons of each action.
						 - Let us look in detail at each of the possible courses of action:

						 - (1) **Submit to the CEO**: This is probably the simplest course of action. For most employees, the simplest thing for them to do is to obey their boss. In this case, the Product Manager might assume that the CEO has the stakeholders interests in mind and decide to defer to the CEO. This could be beneficial to the PM's career, and it might also be beneficial to the company (and its stakeholders) if the CEO is right about the feature. Therefore it fulfills the Product Manager's ethical duty to the CEO and to the company leadership (and stakeholders), but it does not fulfill the PM's ethical duty to his customers.

						 - (2) **Defy the CEO**: This is probably the most difficult course of action for the Product Manager to take. The PM can put his foot down and decide to protect the customers' data while defying his boss. Therefore it fulfills the Product Manager's ethical duty to his customers, but it does not fulfill the PM's ethical duty to the CEO  (and, by extension, to the company leadership and stakeholders).

						 - (3) **Negotiate with the CEO**: This is neither the easiest nor the hardest approach, but it is perhaps the most complex. We saw in the above two courses of action that the PM had to choose between his ethical duty to the customers and his ethical duty to the CEO and the company leadership. However, it is possible that this is a false dichotomy. Perhaps there is no difference between serving the customers and serving the company. If the PM can negotiate with the CEO and come to an understanding wherein the long term interests of the company are aligned with the long term interests of the customers (as things should be), then this dilemma may disappear. Perhaps the PM can explore alternative options such as putting the personalization plans on hold until he can obtain proper customer consent for such use of their data.

						 - So what should the Product Manager do? According to the Product School's advice for Product Managers, they should also consider the ethical code of Product Managers (__How to Be an Ethical Product Manager__, 2019). Much like doctors today are bound to pledge allegiance to the Hippocratic Oath (__Greek Medicine - The Hippocratic Oath__, 2002), Product School is suggesting that Product Managers should also have their own similar ethical code that they are held accountable to.

				 - Regulatory oversight concerns what a company is required to do in order to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries they do business in. Business ethics on the other hand includes more than simply complying with the laws and regulations. Issues concerning business ethics are a super-set of issues concerning regulatory oversight. Business ethics indicates what a company will do over and above what is required by laws and regulations.

From my experience working in the technology industry, I can speak to a hypothetical example about data privacy. In the domain of data privacy, 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an example of regulatory oversight. Complying with GDPR is a basic requirement for all companies that are dealing with customer data in the relevant countries. However, even after complying with all of GDPR, there are still several questions around business ethics that must be resolved.  For example, a company may be faced with the decision of whether or not they should use personally identifiable information to improve their product recommendation engine via Machine Learning.  Even if they are complying with GDPR, this is still an ethical concern that the company must address. Even if the company has the consent of all of its users to use the data in this manner, the company must still ask whether or not it is ethical to do so.

				 - As per the framework for auditing that is described in the textbook, the first step that Charles needs to take in creating an ethics audit for “Butterfly” company is to secure commitment from the top management and the board of directors. Then, after this first step, there are several more steps to be taken such as establishing a committee, defining the process, collecting and analyzing information, etc. However, the first step (securing commitment) is a pre-requisite for all of the other steps. In this case, it seems that Charles is already having difficulty securing the commitment of the CEO. Therefore, none of the other steps are even applicable until the commitment can be secured. Given that Charles doesn't seem to have the commitment for his CEO, what can he do? One option would be to try to go around the CEO and talk directly to the board of directors, in order to secure their commitment. This is a dangerous option for Charles, because it severely endangers his relationship with his CEO and therefore his future job prospects at the company. Another option is for Charles to secure commitment for the top management that is one level below the CEO. This may be easier for Charles to do, since he has existing relationships with these people, and is likely able to influence them. Therefore, I would recommend that Charles start talking to the managers one level below the CEO and try to secure their commitment (or at least begin by assessing whether or not they are likely to commit).

id:: 104a20a6-7275-4289-b623-5c12c847cc10
					 - • Which course of action you would choose? And why? If you were personally involved in the scenario, you can detail what you DID do compared to what you WOULD do given what you have learned in this course.
						 - I would choose the third option: (3) **Negotiate with the CEO**: The Product manager can negotiate with the CEO and get him to change his mind about this feature request by presenting the voice of the customer.

						 - First of all, we should observe that neither of the other two proposed courses of action is a good one. The problem with the first option of submitting to the CEO is that it requires the product manager to potentially cause ethical harm to the customers whose interests he is supposed to safeguard. Similarly, the problem with the second option of defying the CEO is that it requires the product manager to potentially cause ethical harm to his leadership and to his shareholders whose interests he is supposed to safeguard. Moreover, this option is also extremely risky for the product manager, as it might cause him to lose his job and possibly to burn bridges with people in the industry, which may make it more difficult in future to get another job in the same industry.

						 - The option of negotiating with the CEO is also attractive because it is likely to avoid a lose-lose situation. Rather than being faced with two bad options of siding with the customers or siding with the leadership and shareholders, it is possible through negotiation to reconcile both sides and bring them onto the same page. First, it involves the product manager drawing a distinction between the company's short term interests and long term interests. While it is quite possibly in the short term interests of the company to build this recommendation product (even at the cost of customer favorability), the long terms business interests of the company must be aligned with what the customers want. 

						 - As observed by the Harvard Law School: "The short-termism of executive incentives is a major problem alleged by academics, practitioners, and policymakers—they lead to the CEO taking myopic actions that boost the short-term stock price at the expense of long-run value. " (The Long-Term Consequences of Short-Term Incentives, 2017) Thus, it is up to the product manager to make a convincing case to the CEO that the long term interests of the CEO (and the company) must be hitched to the long term interests of the customers, and the product manager can (and should) back up his claim with some customer research.

					 - • Provide your own opinions: do not rephrase the opinions of others, create your own, unique viewpoint based on your ethical philosophy, ethical decision-making framework, and the context and scenario of the case.
						 - There is a growing movement within the product management community that is encouraging product managers to develop their own ethical code, much like other professions have their own ethical code. Perhaps the most famous of these ethical codes is the Hippocratic oath of doctors (__Greek Medicine - The Hippocratic Oath__, 2002). Much like doctors are ethically bound not to cause harm to their patients, I believe that product managers should also have their own ethical code that binds them to not harm their customers. These days we see many companies that are keen to use features that harm customers in the long run by addicting them to the product and getting them to spend more money on the product (for example: think of Candy Crush and several such slot-machine like games on the iPhone which are known to lead to addictive behavior that is much like a gambling addiction). This movement towards developing an ethical code for product managers is being spearheaded by organizations such as Product School which have a great reputation in the product management community (__How to Be an Ethical Product Manager__, 2019).

						 - In my opinion, this forms the third major duty of the product manager. In the previous section, I discussed that the two major duties of the product manager are first to his customers and second to his leadership and shareholders. The third major duty of the product manager is to be accountable to the ethical code of product managers. In fact, to go one step beyond being accountable, the product manager should use this negotiation with the CEO as an opportunity to proactively write the ethical code of conduct for the company that will define its future. The requirement for such an ethical code is sure to come up again and again for product managers at the company, therefore it is better to use this as an opportunity to develop a long term solution to the problem rather than just a one-off solution to this particular disagreement between the product manager and the CEO.  

					 - • Clearly demonstrate and explain how the pros of your solution outweigh the cons.
						 - The primary pros of this solution are that (1) it uses negotiation to avoid the bad outcomes of the other proposed courses of action, (2) it aligns the incentives of the customers and the business, leading to long term business alignment.

						 - (1) Using negotiation to drive positive outcomes. When gridlocked in a situation where it seems like one is stuck between two bad outcomes, negotiating an alternative is always one of the best strategies. According to a recent Forbes article, using negotiation in everyday business scenarios has several important benefits (Prossack, 2018).

						 - (2) Alignment of customer and business objectives. The key to the long term success of a business is that incentives need to be aligned for the customers and for the business. According to an article by Harvard Business Review, organizational alignment such that the long term incentives of customers and the business leadership are aligned is a key determinant of business success (__How Aligned Is Your Organization?__, 2017).

						 - Therefore, the course of action I have chosen - to negotiate with the CEO and convince him that the long term interests of the company and the customers can be aligned around strong data privacy norms - is the best course of action.

			 - What were the topics?
				 - In this week's coursework I learned about how to manage ethics programs in organizations. I studied a case study involving how other organizations are developing their ethics programs, what pitfalls they are running into, and how to get around these pitfalls. I also learned how to apply the concept of ethics programs to the tech industry.

			 - How does it relate to your work? 
				 - As a Product Manager at Adobe, I need to be aware of ethical concerns around data privacy, and about how customers are thinking about these concerns. Several customers who use my products take ethics and data privacy very seriously, and they have their own codes of ethics and ethics programs within their organizations to deal with these issues. Therefore, the coursework and the case studies I have read this week will help me better relate to customers in conversations around ethics and data privacy.

				 - Loss aversion is the phenomenon of people engaging in highly risk-seeking behavior in an attempt to avoid losses (when one wouldn't have engaged in such a risk for a similar gain). For example, if I ask you get into a fist-fight for the possibility of gaining $100, you may say no, because fist-fighting is too risky of an activity for you to engage in, but then if I ask you to get into a fist-fight to prevent the possibility of losing $100 that you already have, then you might say yes. This is a clear example of loss aversion. The risk and the reward is the same in both cases. The reward is always $100, and the risk is engaging in a fist-fight. However, when framed as a loss, people are more likely to engage in such behavior as opposed to when it is framed as a gain. Thus, the lesson here is that we should always try to re-frame the problem in such a way that we don't engage in risk-seeking behavior driven by loss-aversion.

				 - "What are the responsibilities of the American firm purchasing components from a factory overseas where working conditions would not be considered acceptable by Western standards?" As long as the American firm is providing better working conditions than the average local working conditions, I think this is a net benefit. When compared to American working conditions, it may be poor, but compared to the alternatives that the workers have in that country, it is still a good condition.

				 - "Of some of the goods you consume that are produced in other countries, choose one and report on what is known about the working conditions where components are made": I purchase Apple products, which I really love. It is well-known that Apple employs Chinese labor through an intermediary company known as FoxConn. The work standards of FoxConn employees are wildly different than the work standards of Apple employees. FoxConn employees have to work much longer hours for much less pay compared to Apple employees.

				 - "Would you be willing to pay more for a product so workers in other countries have better working conditions?" No, I would not be willing to pay more solely for this reason. Rather, if I wanted to help people who live in poverty or who suffer from poor working conditions, I would (and I actually do) donate money to charities that help people in such conditions. So for example, if a product costs $100 when produced with better working conditions, and if a product costs $50 when produced with poor working conditions, I would buy the $50 product and donate $40 to charity, and I would still come out $10 ahead. But of course, one should be careful in selecting which charity one donates to, to ensure that the money is spent effectively.

				 - Some of the most important lessons that I learned from this course:

				 - Lesson 1: there doesn't have to be a conflict between business ethics and professional development. Often it may seem as if we need to choose between one or the other, but there is always a way to maintain both. One should always look for out of the box solutions and unconventional approaches to try to maintian this balance between business ethics and professional advancement.

				 - Lesson 2: always seek to understand the situation from the perspective of all the various stakeholders involved in the situation. Step into their shoes, and understand how the world looks to them. What are their individual value systems? How is that impacting the situation?

				 - Lesson 3: Understand the individual and organizational factors at play that are impacting any ethical situation. Rather than jumping to conclusions fast, one should deeply analyze the individual factors and organizational factors that are impacting ethical situations.

					 - QA and testing lead

				 - Note that I have only listed the leads for each function. Each of the leads may have several team members under them (e.g. the development lead will likely have a team of developers / engineers under them).

				 - I believe that the development lead (and the developers under the development lead) are the most important people in an IT project, because they are the ones that will actually build and develop the project. Most successful tech companies and projects are successful due to how good their engineering talent is. All the rest of the roles in the team are their to support the developers and to ensure that they do a good job at development.

				 - Of course, in reality, all of those roles are important, and I do not think that one should rank order those roles from most to least important, because this is ultimately a collaborative exercise, and each team member (and each function) is crucial to the success of the overall project. Even the best development team could not build a great product or implement a great project without a great designer, and so on.

					 - Technical problems: How to ensure that users can easily access the data? Where to store the data? How to ensure that the data isn't deleted?

					 - Legal problems: How to get signatures confirming that employees received treatment from the doctor? How to ensure that these digital signatures are legally valid?

				 - How a Systems Analyst would propose to address those concerns
					 - A Systems Analyst would leverage their various skillsets (technical, business, interpersonal, etc.) to address the above concerns. Here are some specific suggestions below:

					 - Technical: Analyst should leverage his technical expertise to study the technical questions in detail and come up with proposed solutions (e.g. using a public cloud based solution to ensure data availability).

					 - Business: Analyst should leverage his knowledge of the business to align this project's goals with the business priorities, such that other members of the organization will be incentivized to support his project (e.g. securing executive support for the paperless project).

					 - Interpersonal: It is well known that "any systems analyst has to have great interpersonal skills and the ability to manage people" (__Top Four Skills Required in a Systems Analyst | Job Awareness: Know about Jobs and Job Descriptions.__, 2013). This is needed for convincing stakeholders across the organization to collaborate on the project.

					 - About the company: HealthAI is a web and mobile application (build by a startup company of the same name) that provides personalized fitness and nutrition recommendations to users based on AI analysis of the customers' health data. The customers can either manually input their data (such as height, weight, activity level, etc.) or they can connect their smartwatch application to automatically import this data.

					 - About the project: GDPR and HIPAA compliance. Since HealthAI is collecting health data about its users and it is in the healthcare domain, it needs to start ensuring compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.

				 - Business need
					 - Since HealthAI operates globally across the US market and the EU market, it is obligated to follow the laws and regulations of the countries that it is operating in. Due to operating in the EU market, it is subject to GDPR requirements. Due to operating in the USA market and working with health data, it is obligated to comply with HIPAA requirements.

				 - Business requirements
					 - According to MindSea, there are four key requirements for HIPAA compliance, which are listed below (__What Healthcare Startups Should Know About HIPAA Compliance__, 2020).
						 - HIPAA Privacy Rule

						 - HIPAA Security Rule

						 - HIPAA Breach Notification Rule

						 - HIPAA Enforcement Rule

					 - According to the Startups magazine, these are the key requirements for GDPR compliance, which are listed below (__How Startups Can Easily Comply With The GDPR__, 2018).
						 - Consent box and record with it the Privacy Policy version (Article 7)

						 - Have double opt-in on your newsletter, lead magnets & sign up (Article 7)

						 - Right of access feature (I want to access all my data i.e. export & import feature) (Article 15)

						 - Right to edit or modify user data feature (Article 16)

						 - Automatic deletion or provide a timeline for deletion of the data feature to your users (Article 17)

						 - Right to delete or forget user feature (Article 17)

						 - Right to object the processing & profiling feature (Article 21 & 22)

						 - Right to stop automated profiling (Articles 18 & 23)

				 - Project work plan
					 - This section will contain a detailed list of all the tasks to be completed, together with the following columns on information for each task:
						 - Description

						 - Workstream

						 - Responsible individual

						 - Status

						 - Form submission is validated and the email address entered is determined to be valid

					 - Normal course
						 - After form submission, user receives an email sent to the email address submitted in the form, requesting user to confirm that they have signed up for the newsletter.

						 - User has the option to directly click on a confirmation link, or navigate to a confirmation url / enter a confirmation code.

						 - If the user completes the confirmation process, then they should start receiving email newsletters.

						 - If the user does not complete the confirmation process, then they should not start receiving email newsletters and their information should not be stored in the system.

					 - Postconditions
						 - Confirmed users are added to the email newsletter list and start receiving email newsletters.

						 - Non-confirmed users are not added to the list and their user data is not stored.

				 - Use case 2: Right to delete user data
					 - Description
						 - Users have the right to request companies to delete their user data, which is also known as the right to be forgotten. If a user makes such a request, then the company should delete all data they have pertaining to that user. This should include profile information (such as the user's name, address, etc.) and event information (such as the user's transaction history, etc.). This is a requirement for GDPR compliance.

					 - Trigger 
						 - User submits a request for deletion of user data.

					 - Trigger type
						 - Event trigger.

					 - Preconditions
						 - User data is stored in the system with a user ID and other identifiable fields.

						 - User who is making the deletion request has a user ID or other fields (e.g. phone number) that is identifiable.

						 - User submits a deletion request with the identifiable fields specified.

						 - User is verified to be the user they are claiming to be.

					 - Normal course
						 - All datasets and records identified with the user are identified (every record is searched for a match with one of the user's identifiers).

						 - Records with matching user identifiers are identified and the identifier is deleted. (E.g. if the user made a $100 transaction, the transaction will still be stored so that revenue reporting is accurate, but the user's identifiable information is removed from the transaction).

					 - Postconditions
						 - Message indicating successful completion of the user data is sent to the user.

				 - The focus of this week's coursework was: Analysis

			 - What were the topics?
				 - In this week's coursework we learned about how to develop and detail functional and non-functional requirements for any given IT system, project, or product. Moreover, we learned how to detail use cases including preconditions, normal course, and postconditions for a variety of use cases. In the assignment, I learned how to apply these concepts to develop requirements and use cases for a fictional project I created (GDPR and HIPAA compliance for HealhAI).  

			 - How does it relate to your work?
				 - As a Product Manager for Adobe Experience Platform, I am responsible for developing the Product Requirements for my product area. I need to write several Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for areas I am working on. The concept of System Requirement Documents (SRDs) that we learned about in this course is very similar to PRDs, and the learnings are very applicable to my work. Moreover, the assignment I am working on (GDPR compliance) is closely related to an actual project I work on at Adobe (GDPR compliance for AEP).

				 - An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) can be used to describe business rules involving a flow of information. Per the textbook's definition, "An ERD is a picture which shows the information that is created, stored, and used by a business system," (Dixon & Wixom, 2015, p. 188).

Two examples drawn from the world of ecommerce are as follows (1) a customer placing an order for a product, and (2) a customer updating their login information.

(1) The ERD for a customer placing an order will have two entities - the customer and the order. These two entities will be connected by the relationship of the customer "places" the order. The customer will have attributes for customer ID, name, address, email, login, etc. The order will have attributes for order ID, order date, order time, product IDs, etc.

(2) The ERD for a customer updating their login information will have two entities - the customer and the login database. These two entities will be connected by the relationship of customer "updates login" on login database. The customer will have attributes as earlier for customer ID, name, login, etc. The login database will have attributes for usernames and (hashed) passwords.

				 - A process model is a representation of business processes and systems. Per the textbook's definition "A process model is a graphical way of representing how a business system should operate," (Dixon & Wixom, 2015, p. 153). As such, process models are an integral part of the systems analyst's toolkit. The typical graphical representations for process modeling is in the form of "data flow diagrams". A data flow diagram will contain processes, data flows, data stores, and external entities.

However, as the textbook notes, "Most business processes are too complex to be explained in one DFD," (Dixon & Wixom, 2015, p. 158). Therefore, the analyst will need to decompose the process model into several DFDs. There needs to be a context diagram which shows the highest level view of the business process, followed by several levels of diagrams (DFD level 0, level 1, level 2, etc.) showing further lower levels of detail about the business process. The decomposition process will continue until the low level DFD is made up of single tasks rather than multiple tasks. As clarified by the textbook "the ultimate goal is to decompose a process so that each child process performs one essential task, not multiple tasks," (Dixon & Wixom, 2015, p. 160). Therefore the analyst must keep decomposing and opening up further levels of DFDs until the building blocks are single tasks rather than multiple task composites.

				 - System overview
					 - As described in the requirements document, the goal of this system is to implement GDPR and HIPAA compliance for the company HealthAI, which is collecting user data including health related data. 

					 - While the requirements document lists a comprehensive set of requirements and use cases that the system must implement, this system design document will focus on the details of two major use cases: (1) GDPR email newsletter double opt in, and (2) GDPR user deletion request.

					 - The following section will present the context diagrams for both of the use cases. Then the following sections will describe the design of the front end as well as the design of the back end.

				 - Context diagrams
					 - The following are the context diagrams for the major use cases that are the focus of this system design document.

					 - Context diagram 1: GDPR email newsletter double opt in system

					 - Context diagram 2: GDPR user deletion request

				 - Front end design: User Interface
					 - Front end for GDPR email newsletter double opt in: The front end here consists of three components: (1) initial sign up, (2) email confirmation, and (3) final confirmation. The front end UI for email newsletters starts with the email newsletter sign up page. This page must include a description of the email newsletter, as well as a call to action to sign up for the email newsletter. The email newsletter sign-up form will include fields for the user to enter their sign up information, including first name, last name, and email address. This is the first step in the front end design. The next step is the email confirmation. The front end for this is the content of the email confirmation that is displayed to the user. This email confirmation should include all of the information entered by the user as well as details of the newsletter to be signed up for, including a confirmation link for the user to click on. Then we move on to the final step which is the final confirmation. Clicking on the email confirmation link will redirect the user to a final confirmation page showing that they have successfully completed the sign up process.

					 - Front end for GDPR user deletion request: The front end for the GDPR user deletion request is very simple, and it consists of two user interface screens: (1) deletion request form, and (2) deletion confirmation screen. In the first step the user is directed to a user deletion request form wherein the user must enter their personally identifiable information including first name, last name, and email address. Then, the system will process the request and present the user either with an error or with a confirmation that the deletion request has been processed. 

				 - Back end design: Application and database
					 - Back end for GDPR email newsletter double opt in: The back end for the email newsletter consists of only two steps: (1) adding the user to a temporary sign-up database, and (2) adding the user to a final sign-up database. In the first step, when the user initially signs up for the newsletter, they are added to a temporary database which stores unconfirmed newsletter sign-ups. Then, after the user completes the final confirmation, the next step is to remove the user from the temporary database and move them into the final database. As a post-condition of this design, all users in the final database should be receiving regular email newsletters. However, if the user does not complete the confirmation within a set amount of time (e.g. 24 hours), then they should anyway be deleted from the temporary table.

					 - Back end for GDPR user deletion request: The back end of the GDPR user deletion request consists of two steps: (1) checking for matching records, (2) deleting matching records or returning an error. In the first step, based on the user input given, the system will check all records for matches with the user. If a match is found, then all records with matching user identifiers will be deleted. All databases will have the relevant rows deleted. If no match is found, then no action is taken, but an error is triggered.

			 - What was the focus of the coursework this week?
				 - The focus of this week's coursework was: process and data modeling. We learned about how to translate requirements into detailed process and data models using various tools and best practices.

			 - What were the topics?
				 - This week we learned in detail about how to translate system requirements into process and data models. We learned about using Entity Relationship Diagrams to diagram these models. We also learned about process models and Data Flow Diagrams as further tools for modeling. In the assignment, I got some hands on experience working with these tools as I translated the system requirements for my HealthAI GDPR project into context diagrams and developed a system design document for my project. 

			 - How does it relate to your work?
				 - As a Product Manager for Adobe, it is an important part of my job not only to develop the product requirements for my product (which are much like system requirements), but it is also important for me to translate my product requirements into the next level of detail so that front end and back end engineers have a clear understanding of the requirements and can start building on them. Therefore the tools I learned to use this week (ERDs, DFDs, system design documents, etc.) will be highly relevant for my ability to communicate product requirements as a product manager.

				 - Traditional Application Service Providers (ASP) as well as Software as a Service (SaaS) are two of the major alternatives to building custom software systems in-house. The advantages of such packages over custom development is that they often save time and cost (because we are outsourcing the system development to those who have significant expertise in the domain). However, the disadvantages of such packages is that they are not fully customizable to an organization's requirements. Since ASPs and SaaS vendors must cater to several different customers, it is unlikely that the system is tailored to the exact needs of any one organization. Therefore it needs further customization and system integration work. However, these days, many organizations feel that such packages are a better alternative to custom development. In such a case, the organization still needs to choose between the two options for the packages: ASP or SaaS?

What are the differences between ASP and SaaS? The core difference is that "ASP model is generally a Single-Instance, Single-Tenant Legacy Software application," (Murphy, 2015). Whereas on the other hand SaaS is a multi-tenant architecture. What this means is that ASP is somewhere in between the custom development approach and the SaaS approach. With ASP, the customer will get more customizability and an individual implementation, but this may lead to higher costs and decreased scalability. The advantage of SaaS is that they can offer lower costs due to economies of scale. So ultimately my choice would depend on how much customization is needed. If there is an off-the shelf solution that works well for me, I would choose SaaS. Else I would go for ASP or custom development.

				 - The architectural design is an implementation solution for a given set of system requirements. For mobile applications, we need to choose between building native applications or using cross-platform frameworks. The advantages of a native application are that they will offer a better user experience and more integration with the device hardware. For example, a native iOS application will offer a better experience to iPhone users. However, the cost of developing native applications for all mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) will be very high in terms of development costs. Therefore, it may be much more cost effective to use a cross platform development framework. 

For example, suppose you are developing a simple task manager application. You want this application to be accessible via web, desktop, Android, iPhone, Kindle, etc. In today's cross-platform and cross-device environment, we need to enable users to access their task list whether they are on their desktop while at work, or whether they are on their mobile device on the go. Now we need to decide whether it is worthwhile to invest in developing native applications for each platform (which would offer a better user experience), or whether to leverage a cross platform framework which may offer a worse user experience, but better integration and more efficient development. This is a strategic business decision that must be made based on the overall company strategy. I would personally choose the option of a cross-platform framework for convenience. 

			 - Prompt
				 - How are requirements definitions for a proposed system related to its architectural design?

				 - If one of the requirements is to accommodate multiple languages or mobile platforms, how might that influence the architectural model that you select.

				 - Introduction to the proposals
					 - Problem statement: As mentioned in the previous sections, the goal of this system is to implement GDPR and HIPAA compliance for the HealthAI application which collects personal health related data from its users. The HealthAI application has already been architected and developed; this project only concerns the implementation of GDPR and HIPAA compliance.  

					 - Proposal A: Custom development and implementation of GDPR and HIPAA compliance using in-house developers at HealthAI.

					 - Proposal B: Outsource the development of HIPAA and GDPR compliance by hiring a consulting firm or a service provider firm.

					 - Proposal C: Buy packaged software for GDPR and HIPAA compliance implementation.

				 - Decision matrix and conclusion
					 - Since the proposals for my system closely mirror the proposals for the textbook's example, I am using the same evaluation criteria as the textbook __(Dennis et al., 2015, p. 234)__. However, the rest of the columns are customized to my particular case. 

					 - Based on the decision matrix (refer to the attached Excel document), it seems that proposal B is the best option. This makes sense, because hiring an external vendor or consultant strikes a good balance between custom in-house developed and using a pre-packaged solution.

			 - Prompt
				 - Create an alternative decision matrix for the your system you are proposing. Using Excel or Word, develop a decision matrix to be used to evaluate **three **proposed design alternatives (alternatives A, B, and C).

				 - Criteria: Decision matrix has columns for criteria weights and points available, and columns that represent three proposals. Within each proposal include columns for points assigned and the product of points assigned times criteria weight. The bottom row of the matrix contains column totals __(Dennis et al., 2015, p. 234)__.

			 - What was the focus of the coursework this week?
				 - The focus of this week's coursework was design. We learned about how system requirements relate to architectural designs for the system and we learned about how to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of several different proposed architectures. 

			 - What were the topics?
				 - In this week's coursework, I learned how to relate system requirements to architectural designs. I also learned about different approaches to development comparing custom in house development to Application Service Providers (ASPs) to Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors. I also learned in detail how to compare these alternatives, and I made a detailed alternative decision matrix comparing these alternatives for my assignment.

			 - How does it relate to your work?
				 - Adobe Experience Platform is a SaaS product. Therefore, as a Product Manager for Adobe Experience Platform, it is extremely important for me to learn more about the differences between SaaS and ASPs and custom in-house development. The customers of my product are in fact faced with the same decision of which option to choose, and understanding the pros and cons in detail (as I did in this week's coursework and assignment) helps me relate to my customers more deeply.
