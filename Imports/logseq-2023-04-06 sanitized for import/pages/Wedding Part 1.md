- Two day vacation plans
	 - Hey guys, for the last two nights of your stay (25 - 27), here are my main suggestions:
		 - 1. Mt. Rainier National Park
			 - Stay: cabin / lodge style accommodations.

			 - Activities: hikes, trails, and other outdoor adventures.

			 - See more: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g143044-Mount_Rainier_National_Park_Washington-Vacations.html

		 - 2. San Juan Islands
			 - Stay: hotels / BnB (Rukma and I stayed at a nice BnB here last month).

			 - Activities: whale watching, driving around to farms / lakes / trails, restaurants and bars.

			 - See more: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g58727-San_Juan_Islands_Washington-Vacations.html

		 - 3. Stay in Redmond and visit multiple places
			 - We can do one day-long trip on 26: Choose between Mt. Rainier or whale watching in San Juan islands.

			 - Shorter trips on the other days: Snoqualmie Falls, Wineries in Woodinville, local eateires, etc.

	 - If we choose #3 there's not much planning to do right now. But if we choose #1 or #2 then we need to make hotel reservations. My personal preference is for #3, but 

- Vows
	 - Since we moved in together at the beginning of this year, we've spent almost every minute of every day together, and I still can't get enough of you.

	 - We wake up right next to each other, we work right next to each other, we eat together, we play together, and we do literally everything together. 

	 - This is what I want for rest of my life. It's usually hard for me to feel certain about things like this, but I know for sure that this is what I want.

	 - I've loved you so much, I love you now, and I promise to always love you, and to be with you, no matter what.

- Adobe Donations
	 - Dear All — I understand that several of you have also contributed to a gift campaign initiated by Saurabh which resulted in a total of $820 in contributions. 

My father works for a non-profit in India called [Sparsh Hospice](https://adobe.benevity.org/cause/840-464927295#!tab-about), which Rukma and I would like to support, and we have decided to send the contributions there. **Since Adobe matches this donation, our contribution has doubled from $820 to $1640!** 

Rukma and I are extremely grateful for this contribution from the Adobe family! :)
