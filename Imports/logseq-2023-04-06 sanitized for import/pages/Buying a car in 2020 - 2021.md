	 - Hi — I'm in the market for a new Mitsubishi Mirage, and I'm hoping to close a deal within the next few weeks. This will be a cash transaction, so no financing is needed. Could you please let me know the out-the-door price for any inventory matching the following criteria? Thank you!
		 - Make / Model: Mitsubishi Mirage

		 - Type: Hatchback

		 - Transmission: Automatic

		 - Year: 2018 / 2019 / 2020

		 - Trim: ES / LE / SE

	 - I'm looking for the cheapest possible vehicle you have matching the above criteria. Due to Covid risks, I need to minimize in-person interactions, so it would be great if we could come to an agreement via email / phone, and I will come in to finalize the transaction. Thank you, and I look forward to working with you! :)
