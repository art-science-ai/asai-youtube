title: Unwinding Anxiety
---

- Exercises
	 - Map my anxiety triggers and loops

- Module 0: Introduction
	 - Set goals and set reminders to check-in

	 - What are my goals?
		 - I want to welcome my emotions and feelings.

		 - I want to overcome my anxiety and unhelpful behaviors.

	 - Took a questionnaire on how in touch I am with my body - score pretty low

- Module 1: What is anxiety
	 - Fear and worry about unknown and uncertain things.

	 - Anxiety habit loops
		 - Negative thought > distraction (reddit) > reward

		 - Negative thought > out of control thinking and self-criticism > ball of anxiety

	 - Anxiety habit loops are running on auto-pilot; I need to regain control

- Module 2: Anxiety triggers
	 - Anxiety triggers are external events, thoughts, and body sensations. For me I think it's:
		 - Thoughts about past events

		 - Thoughts about things I haven't done

		 - Thoughts about future

	 - Anxiety trigger thought is what triggers the anxiety habit loop. Trigger > worry thinking > more anxiety. 

	 - Learn to identify and be curious about the thoughts and body sensations that trigger my anxiety.
