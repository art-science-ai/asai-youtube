- DONE Kyle Jensen / Call Yale registrar for grade for transfer credit #2021-W44
	 - Hi Kyle,

Hope you're doing well! :) I've been enjoying my full-time PM job at Adobe + part-time CS masters at UPenn. In other news, I also recently got married to Rukma Sen, whom you may remember as my fellow MBA (and MGT-656) student at Yale!

I'm writing to request your help with a transfer credit application at UPenn. I petitioned UPenn to get transfer credit for MGT-656, and they have conditionally approved my petition, but as per their policy I need to prove that I earned a grade of "B" or higher. My actual grade was "H" (ref: attached transcript), but they are unwilling to accept this in lieu of a letter grade.

My request to you: Would you be willing to send them an email saying something like "if we had used a traditional letter grading system for this course, Nikhil would have earned a grade of B or higher"? (In case it helps sway your decision, I just wanted to remind you that my team's final project for your course was voted as the "best project" by the entire class.)

Please do let me know if possible, and thanks very much in advance for your help! :)

Best,
Nikhil
