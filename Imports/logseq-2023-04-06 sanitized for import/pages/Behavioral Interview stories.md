			 - 1. “How many dedicated engineers, designers, and analysts would this PM lead?”

			 - A PM who is influencing other engineering teams has an uphill battle vs one leading a large engineering team. A PM with just engineers has a more uphill battle than one with designers and analysts.

			 - 2. “What product rituals does the team practice?”

			 - Different product teams have different planning, review, and sprint cycles. Some practice regularly discovery. Others leave that for other teams. Some review results together. Other’s don’t.

			 - 3. “Would you describe the culture as product-led?”

			 - Many orgs are engineering led (even if they say they are product led). Others are exec led. Some are design-led (like most gaming companies).

			 - 4. “How is PM retention here compared to previous places you worked?”

			 - Retention is one of the best all-in indicators. If PMs often leave, you can expect some negative conditions. Perhaps they ask too much of PMs, or don’t empower them.

			 - 5. “What are the biggest challenges someone in this role will face?”

			 - Each role is different. Some face challenges in getting permission to work on other’s surfaces. Others’ roadmaps are filled by foundational support for other teams.

			 - 6. “What are the toughest things about being a PM here?”

			 - PMs can face a myriad of different challenges, from influencing to getting resources to graduating experiments.

			 - 7. “What do you like least about the culture here?”

			 - Some move super fast, and PM’s roadmaps experience a lot of thrash. Even more move slowly, and PM’s struggle to ship many consequential features.

			 - 8. “Are you design, engineering, analytics, PM constrained - or something else?”

			 - Every team is constrained somewhere, even at FAANG. Figure out what the constraint is.

			 - 9. “How is the process of working with legal and compliance?”

			 - In highly regulated industries, bad legal teams gum up each and every feature. Others just slow them down.

			 - Remember the ‘5 Whys’ technique. If the interviewer gives a concise response, follow up with specific questions. This shows you care about the answer and are good at getting to the “real” why as a PM.

- --- GENERAL QUESTIONS ---

- Introductory 1-1
	 - My goal for this meeting is just to introduce myself to

	 - I'd like to spend a couple of minutes 

	 - --

	 - I was born and raised in Hyderabad, India. During elementary school, I moved abroad with my parents. We spent four years across three different cities in the UK and the US, and then we moved back to Hyderabad for my middle school and high school. That's where most of my family still lives and I still go back there about once every year.

	 - After high school I came to the US to attend college at the University of Chicago, where I majored in philosophy, but I was also really interested in math. That led me to pursue a master's degree in logic at the University of Amsterdam, which was an interdisciplinary research program across philosophy, math, computer science, and linguistics - basically the early foundations of AI.

	 - My original career goal was to do a PhD and become an academic, but along the way I realized that wasn't the best fit for me. After my master's I moved back to India and started work as a management consultant with Deloitte. This was my introduction to the corporate world. 

	 - After three years at Deloitte, I moved to the US again to get my MBA at Yale. This was a significant experience for me personally and professionally. On the personal front, I started dating my classmate Rukma and she's now my wife! On the professional front I started taking a lot of coursework in computer science and machine learning, which is what led me to my product management career.

	 - I spent three years as a Product Manager for Adobe, where I worked on two products. First was Adobe Experience Platform, which is a customer data platform used by enterprise marketing teams. The user problem I was solving was the difficulty in unifying and standardizing customer data from several different sources. Second was Adobe Acrobat, which is used by customers to read and edit PDF documents. The user problem I was solving there was that it's a real pain to read PDFs on mobile devices - you have to constantly pinch and zoom and pan the document around. We developed an ML based solution called Liquid Mode which converts the PDF to a mobile responsive HTML style document. 

	 - Besides work, I also completed a part time masters degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania during my time at Adobe.

	 - Outside of work, I live in the Bay Area with my wife Rukma who works as a PMM at Google. Some of my interests include - (1) reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy, and (2) more recently playing a lot of VR table tennis on my Quest.

- Tell me about yourself
	 - Meta
		 - I'm a product manager on Meta's Ads Core ML team, which builds and deploys ML models to personalize ads across all Meta products.

		 - My goal is to figure out how we we can personalize ads while respecting user privacy and being resilient to regulatory and platform changes and risks.

		 - I lead a number of cross-functional projects to onboard new sources of data into our ads delivery stack and to maximize the value from that data.

	 - Adobe - DCAI
		 - I'm a Senior Product Manager for the Adobe Acrobat Mobile application, and I lead our next generation of PDF viewing experiences which we call "Liquid Mode". 

		 - The main user problem we're trying to solve is that PDFs are very difficult to read on mobile devices because PDFs are typically designed for print or for large screens. Users need to pinch and zoom and move the PDF around to read on mobile - and that's a real pain in the neck!

		 - The solution we offer is an interactive and mobile-responsive PDF reading experience, and we deliver this experience by using ML to extract the structure and content from PDFs and converting it to a responsive HTML-style document.

		 - My key success metric is the monthly active usage of Liquid Mode, and I've significantly grown this metric by discovering, prioritizing and delivering key features such as on-device ML to improve conversion success and speed and the ability to automatically open files in LM to increase user engagement.

		 - I work cross-functionally with 4 eng teams - iOS, Android, DX, and ML performance teams - as well as Research, Design, UX, and Marketing.

	 - Adobe - AEP
		 - Prior to that I was a PM on Adobe Experience Platform, which is a customer data platform used by enterprise marketing teams to build business intelligence dashboards and predictive models. 

		 - The user problem I was solving over there was that marketing data scientists and data analysts had a hard time unifying and standardizing customer data from multiple sources.

		 - I was responsible for discovering this user problem and for launching a data preparation product that went from zero to over 30 enterprise customer by working cross-functionally with several teams across engineering, data-science, research, PMM and sales.

		 - I have a diverse set of PM experiences: zero to one product launch in the enterprise world, driving growth and user engagement in the consumer world.

	 - Deloitte
		 - Prior to Adobe, I worked as a strategy consultant for Deloitte, where I developed my skills in growth strategy and in cross-functional program management - both of which as extremely helpful to my role as a PM today.

	 - Education
		 - I have a multidisciplinary educational background - including an MBA from Yale and I'm currently pursuing a part-time CS master's at UPenn.

	 - Personal
		 - Outside of work, some of my interests include running, meditation and reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy.

- Why am I leaving Adobe?
	 - I'm currently not very inspired by the product vision of Adobe Acrobat - Adobe's vision is to re-invent PDF for modern user needs. But I honestly believe PDF is becoming less and less relevant for modern document creation and consumption needs.

	 - So I think it's best for me to look for a new challenge that I find inspiring and impactful.

- Why company X?
	 - LinkedIn
		 - Mission and vision
			 - The mission and vision of LI and the Standardized Data team - curating the data in LI's vast economic graph to help connect people to opportunities in new ways. I find that very inspiring and impactful.

		 - AI / ML opportunities
			 - I'm really passionate about machine learning and AI. Through my professional and educational pursuits, I've been trying to develop that as my primary area of focus.

			 - LI's economic graph is one of the most valuable and interesting datasets, because of (1) its massive scale - mapping every member, company, job, and school, and (2) the kind of insights it offers - like spotting trends like talent migration, hiring rates, and in-demand skills by region. 

	 - Meta
		 - Impact
			 - So much of my interaction with my friends, family and various communities that I'm part of is mediated through Meta products such as WhatsApp, IG, FB.

			 - This is true not only for me, but for billions of people across the world.

			 - If I can shape even a tiny piece of this way in which billions of people are interacting with each other world, I would find that extremely meaningful and impactful.

		 - Product culture
			 - I've also seen a lot of my friends, classmates, and other people I respect go on to become PMs at Meta.

			 - Through my conversations with them - which have always been very interesting - I've learned that Meta has a very product-centric culture, and there's a lot I can learn.

	 - Waymo
		 - Mission and impact
			 - Not only for the safety implications of making self-driving cars a reality, but I think of self-driving cars as "one giant leap for mankind" in terms of scientific advancement. 

			 - That's a much better motivation for me to wake up and go to work in the morning.

		 - Cutting edge AI research
			 - I've always been interested in AI - especially NLP and Computer Vision. I wrote my masters thesis a long time ago on NLP, and as part of a recent project for my CS masters I built a CV application based on facial recognition.

		 - People and culture
			 - I had several interviews with Waymo last year, and it ultimately didn't work out, but every conversation that I had was extremely engaging and intellectually stimulating. 

			 - Reminded me of conversations I had as a master of logic student - interdisciplinary program with computer scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, linguists.

	 - Apple
		 - Inspired by product vision and the impact I can have
			 - Delivering meaningful user experiences through conversational AI - with the potential to impact 1B+ customers is something I would find very inspiring and impactful.

		 - Siri Knowledge
			 - Knowledge representation is an area I've been interested in since college. 

			 - Recently I've been diving into ML / AI through my work and through my CS masters

	 - OpenAI
		 - Dream company to work for for anybody interested in AI
			 - GPT-2/3, Codex, DALL-E

		 - Impact
			 - Contributing to OpenAI's mission of developing AGI in a a way that benefits all of humanity is the single most meaningful and impactful thing I could be doing with my career. 

		 - Culture
			 - Intersection of academia and business is where I thrive.

			 - Interested in the question

	 - Google
		 - Impact

		 - Culture

		 - Why Google Research
			 - Cutting edge AI research - Google brain

			 - Intersection of academia and business

- Strengths
	 - Intellectual curiosity 
		 - I'm the kind of person who is never satisfied with a surface level explanation for anything, and I will keep asking "why" to dig deeper into the explanation and connect it to some first-principles I understand.

		 - The first-principles thinking that motivated me to study philosophy and logic - and later computer science.

		 - Makes me a good product manager, because even though I may be working on a dozen different initiatives, I'm always able to connect each on to my first-principles - user value and business value

	 - Building relationships across teams, disciplines, and cultures
		 - Having grown up, lived, and worked across three different continents, I often play the role of translating between different cultures.

		 - Having studied subjects as wide ranging as philosophy, business, and computer science, I'm very comfortable translating between different disciplines - tech and non texh 

		 - This makes me a good PM, because this translation skill makes me a central linchpin in cross-functional collaborations, because I'm the one that can translate between research, engineering, marketing, design, etc. It also enables me to communicate effectively with a diverse set of stakeholders who have different goals.

	 - Structured and methodical executor
		 - In my personal and professional life — whether I'm starting a new diet or exercise program, learning a new skill, or launching a new product at work — I approach things in a very structured and methodical way.

		 - At every point in time, I make sure to keep track of where I am with respect to my goals, my success metrics, and my project plan or timeline.

		 - This makes me a good PM, because I can easily stay on top of several different projects each of which may have intricate xfn dependencies.

- Weaknesses
	 - Intellectual curiosity / questioning things too much
		 - STRENGTH: I'm the kind of person who is never satisfied with a surface level explanation for anything, and I will keep asking "why" to dig deeper into the explanation and connect it to some first-principles I understand.

		 - WEAKNESS: This can lead to me unnecessarily slowing down projects with my need to understand, or even worse it may seem like I'm not trusting someone else's expertise when they tell me something. E.g. the first time I collaborated with my data science team to run a growth experiment, I kept questioning their hypotheses. She thought I was being critical of her proposal.

		 - MITIGATION: remind myself to contextualize my questions so that they're not perceived as criticism.

	 - Over-reliance on structure
		 - STRENGTH: I always approach projects and initiatives in a very structured and methodical way.

		 - WEAKNESS: I try to impose structure on things where it's not appropriate or where it's not my place to impose a structure. E.g. I was working with a program manager who had an informal communication style, and I created a reporting template for him. My manager told me that wasn't a good idea, because it might seem like I'm stepping on the other team's toes.

		 - MITIGATION: Remember to ask myself - is this worth me investing structure into? Am I the right person to do this?

- Dealing with conflict
	 - Find common ground and then get to the root of the disagreement

	 - Drive consensus and ownership on shared objectives

	 - Collaboration and ownership, motivating them and involving them in customer conversation, in discussions with leadership and making them motivated.

	 - LM growth - difficult person / disagreement / leadership
		 - H
			 - When I became PM for LM in Acrobat Mobile, we had no dev resources for feature work - the product was on life support - but I managed to get resourcing to build new features and grow the product significantly over the past year.

		 - C
			 - For context, the product and engineering org structure for Adobe's Document Cloud business is divided into four teams. There are three teams dedicated to individual products - Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Sign, and Adobe Document Services APIs - and the fourth team is the AI team which develops AI technologies used across all three products.

			 - I'm part of the AI team which owns the dev resources for building and improving the ML models, but the resources to implement these models and the UI in the Acrobat Mobile app are owned by the Acrobat team. 

			 - The situation was that our AI team was ready to invest resources and had a number of improvement ideas, but the Acrobat team was not willing to invest any resources beyond basic life support functions.

		 - A
			 - Understanding the goals of Acrobat team
				 - Primary goal is monetization: converting free to paid user and retaining paid users

				 - Secondary goal is engagement and retention: leading indicator of monetization

			 - Conducted quantitative and qualitative customer research to develop a hypothesis about how Liquid Mode contributes to Acrobat's goals. 
				 - Talking to customers, reading and analyzing reviews and in-app feedback, and analyzing data from product analytics

				 - LM engagement -> Acrobat engagement

			 - Re-prioritized metrics for AI team to align with goals
				 - De-prioritize: speed, precision/recall, accuracy.

				 - Focus on user engagement.

			 - Aligned xfn stakeholders on the new metrics
				 - Did my own data analysis showing correlations between LM usage and App KPIs. 

				 - Then got support of data science team.

			 - Prioritized AI initiatives by the metrics
				 - Analyzed the funnel for LM and prioritized initiatives at each conversion stage.

				 - Top of funnel: Improving our ML model for files with tables

				 - Middle of funnel: Auto-opening files in LM to increase conversion rate 

				 - Bottom of funnel: Improving performance and speed to reduce failures and cancelations

				 - De-prioritized
					 - Readability 

					 - support for >200 page files

					 - Improving the accuracy of models

		 - R
			 - Got funding resourcing for the prioritized projects: auto-open, DTM, CoD. LM usage increased from 25M documents to 75M. 

			 - I aligned all stakeholders around a common set of goals.

			 - I translated the goals to a prioritized set of projects.

		 - L
			 - Include broader xfn stakeholders from the beginning - Acrobat Web

			 - Think about risks of a project - MAU focus leading to negative reviews

	 - LM personalization - conflict / convincing eng
		 - H
			 - As PM for LM, my EM disagreed with me about whether a problem was even worth solving, but I managed to convince him. 

		 - C
			 - Our team was laser-focused on MAU, and to drive MAU we were aggressively prompting users to try LM. While this was driving MAU, we also started getting a lot of negative user reviews about users not wanting to be prompted for LM.

			 - I wanted to solve this problem by improving our algorithm for determining when to show promos, but my EM disagreed that this problem was even worth solving. 

		 - A
			 - Understood the concern
				 - He didn't have context on the customer impact: he wasn't looped into customer feedback and user reviews

				 - He didn't have context on the business impact: he didn't know how much this was impacting various business objectives

				 - He thought this would suck up a lot of resources and detract from other important projects.

			 - Brought the voice of customer to the table
				 - Slack is our main internal communication tool - we use it more than email.

				 - I created a Slack channel that integrated with our app store reviews and automatically posted all reviews mentioning LM to the channel. Added key product and engineering stakeholders.

			 - Voice of the business
				 - User engagement team was closely monitoring drops in App Store ratings (due to several reasons), and this was likely to get escalated to leadership.

				 - Started looping him into key conversations with product leadership where this was being discussed.

			 - Developed a proposal and risk mitigation plan
				 - Short term: stop showing promos to people who dismissed it N times. (Do data analysis to arrive at this number).

				 - Implement the short term proposal as A/B test to monitor results

				 - Long term: promo personalization; will actually increase MAU.

		 - R
			 - EM was convinced that this was an important customer problem to solve. We managed to reduce the negative feedback without impacting MAU in any significant way.

			 - I was able to make the engineering manager feel ownership over the customer impact and the business impact.

		 - L
			 - Balance between sharing too much / too little information with EM

			 - Keep eng looped into voice of customer and business

	 - LM for Acrobat Web - failure
		 - H
			 - A feature that my team spent several months working on suddenly got de-prioritized.

		 - C
			 - I'm the PM for Liquid Mode, which solves the user problem of reading PDFs on mobile devices without constantly having to pinch and zoom. 

			 - I thought there was a huge opportunity in extending this solution to third party web and mobile developers, and Adobe already has an offering called PDF Embed API targeted at web and mobile developers, so I partnered with that team to develop a solution.

			 - Due to a re-org, the Embed API team got merged with the Acrobat Web team, and they decided to de-prioritize this project, because was not well aligned with their goals.

		 - A
			 - I set up time with the Acrobat Web PM lead
				 - I explained where I was coming from and why I thought it was a good opportunity

				 - She said she understood, but their main focus was on tools usage - commenting, editing PDFs, etc. and they needed to prioritize projects accordingly.

				 - She was actually surprised that we had invested so much effort into this project 

			 - Retrospective analysis
				 - I failed to learn about the goals of a broader set of stakeholder

				 - I failed to socialize my efforts widely

			 - Changes I made
				 - I've created a quarterly newsletter going out to a large set of stakeholders

				 - Set up a regular sync w the Acrobat Web PM - monthly 1-1

				 - Re-aligning the project to focus more on commenting - which we're already doing for Mobile. This is now getting prioritized for H2.

		 - R/L
			 - Think about how my product fits into the broader product strategy - not just the immediate products impacted

			 - Socialize the work we're doing as widely as possible.

			 - Include broader set of stakeholders in my set of 1-1s.

	 - ARCHIVE
		 - Viewer modernization conflict w Acrobat team
			 - They wanted to introduce a bunch of features that kicked users out of LM

		 - Conflict with Tushark and Android team
			 - Tushark wanted to prioritize performance improvements - eng gets more credit for those

			 - I wanted to prioritize

id:: 7a0ab907-c85f-4fe1-8282-8e2f24ba5f04
	 - Data prep launch end to end - success / ambiguous
		 - Headline
			 - I discovered and launched our data prep product from zero to over thirty enterprise customers.

		 - C
			 - AEP offers OOTB ML models and BI dashboards to marketing teams. I was hired to discover and launch a new set of models and dashboards. The ultimate goal was to improve sales and revenue for AEP intelligence.

		 - A
			 - Investigated sales funnel
				 - I investigated the sales funnel and did customer research: I discovered that the conversion of POC (free trial) to paid accounts was a significant driver. 

				 - Sales and customer success said that data prep was a huge barrier

				 - Customers had to spend a lot of effort creating custom scripts and using third party tools to prepare their data for BI / ML.

			 - Customer research 
				 - Qualitative research to understand their current workflows, work-arounds, and pain points. Understand the common data preparation operations.

				 - Quantitative research to prioritize the common data prep operations. $100 test.

			 - Business case - Pitching to management - getting resources and prioritization 

			 - Product development
				 - UX mocks and iterated with customers

				 - Collaborated with eng teams

				 - tested with customers. alpha. beta.

			 - Launch
				 - and gtm - pricing and packaging, blogs, evangelism, field enablement, creating demos for the field.

		 - R/L
			 - Significantly improved sales of AEP Intelligence, with Data Prep playing a major role

			 - So succesful that Data Prep is now developing into its own SKU which can be bundled with several other AEP SKUs"

		 - Metrics
			 - Revenue

			 - Usage

			 - Performance

		 - Features
			 - Scheduled flow - ingestion + data prep

			 - Scheduled Queries

			 - Data Prep UI

	 - DSW Foundation - few resources / challenging situation 
		 - Headline
			 - As part of a cost savings effort due to Covid, I proposed and developed a low-cost barebones product SKU for several non-paying accounts. I faced significant opposition from design and provisioning teams, but was eventually able to convince them, leading to cost savings of $2M+ / yr.

		 - Situation
			 - When covid first hit, our VP made cost savings a top priority and set up a cost-governance council where everyone was encouraged to bring cost-savings ideas to the table.

			 - There were several high-cost DSW features that weren't essential for several non-paying customers. My proposal was to (1) developing a low cost product SKU, and (2) identifying and migrating accounts to this SKU.

			 - Presented this to the VP and cost governance council and the concept was approved (first of two milestones: CA / PPC). I had to come up with a detailed plan and get the dependent teams to commit.

		 - Action
			 - Plan 1: Developed a detailed plan including the dependencies on DSW, UX, and Provisioning.
				 - DSW Eng: Defined the back-end configuration for each corresponding UI / package.

				 - Design / UX: Defined UX workflows (including wireframes) for each scenario.

				 - Provisioning: Mapping the back-end and UX to GTM packages.

			 - Roadblock 1: Provisioning and design refused to commit to my project plan because they couldn't prioritize it above other initiatives. 

			 - Plan 2: Developed a proposal to incur technical debt from provisioning and UX.

			 - Roadblock 2: Provisioning and design teams blocked this proposal because it violated their standards. Adobe is a very design focused company and the design team has a lot of power.

			 - Underlying issues: provisioning and design weren't aligned on the significance of cost savings as an objective.

			 - Worked with cost governance council to broaden their reach 
				 - Org-wide weekly email update

				 - Startred including a broader set of stakeholders in the weekly meetings

				 - Started bringing collaborators from provisioning and UX to the cost governance council

			 - Got all stakeholders in the same room on the same page
				 - Outlined the plans and the cost savings implications

				 - Plan 2 was approved

		 - Result
			 - Succesfully realized cost savings of $2M+ / yr and I was personally recognized with a spot award.

	 - Data prep - conflict / difficult person
		 - Situation
			 - I discovered data preparation as a major user problem, made a business case to leadership, and got green light from leadership.

			 - Next step was to make a project plan including commitments from all the dependent teams - two key dependent teams were UI and API teams.

			 - UI EM would not commit unless the proposed UI met their design standards. API EM felt it would take too much work to support the UI workflows.

		 - Action
			 - Understood both of their concerns by taking the time to listen to them
				 - UI: Adobe is a design-driven company and having good UI is a key differentiator.

				 - API team: AEP is an API first product.

				 - Neither team thought it was that significant to the business.

			 - Voice of business
				 - Gave them the presentation on business value and explained the potential revenue impact of this product.

				 - Invited them to the monthly product leadership meeting where this was reviewed.

			 - Voice of the customer
				 - Invited them to a couple of customer discovery calls which I was regularly doing.

				 - They understood that there are different personas

			 - Compromise
				 - Basic mode: great UI.

				 - Advanced mode for power users: not so great UI

		 - R/L
			 - Due to increaaed sense of ownership and empathy I built, was able to get all three of us to work collaboratively on list. 

			 - Both sides softened their positions a little - we had UI with code editor in it"

			 - L: Involve dependent teams from the beginning in business and customer conversations, not at the end.

	 - AEP metering - conflict w manager / convincing eng to build / few resources
		 - H

		 - C
			 - I developed data prep as part of a larger product offering called AEP Intelligence. Now we wanted to separate it out as its own modular product SKU. This required us to have a cost model that isolated the costs of data prep.

			 - Eng was slammed and was not ready to invest resources in building a cost model (even basic feature work was a big ask).

		 - A
			 - Understood eng motivation
				 - They didn't care about the data prep SKU - no way to get credit

				 - He thought it wasn't his job

				 - He couldn't spare the resources

			 - Created a simplified cost model
				 - I got data from finance and usage data and made some simple assumptions

			 - Partnered with other teams
				 - Collaborated with cost governance council to get resources.

		 - R

	 - STEP - success / xfn / leadership
		 - Headline
			 - In my second year with Deloitte, I led the design and delivery of our first ever large scale training program for 800+ consultants. I successfully managed a cross-functional team of 12 and a budget of $1M+.

		 - Situation
			 - The program required inputs from various functional teams across Deloitte — such as the brand marketing team, the travel team, the HR team, the consulting team and so on.

			 - It was my responsibility to recruit and manage these collaborators, but I had no formal authority over the teams.

			 - The managing director delegated this responsibility to me because he trusted me, and there was a lot riding on this, because we were investing $1M+ into this training.

		 - Action
			 - Top down leadership -
				 - Started with a top down approach; identified top level leader of each team and secured buy-in through my managing director.

				 - But I Discovered that teams weren't motivated despite buy-in from their leadership.

			 - Bottom up motivation: buy-in and collaboration
				 - Buy-in: created a website and firm-wide communications campaign. Helped people feel like they were contributing to something important.

				 - Collaboration: Rather than making the entire workplan upfront and hitting them with a bunch of deadlines, I began to involve them early on in the planning process. Often there were no significant differences between the workplans, but they would feel much more committed.

		 - Result
			 - Training program was universally praised by participants, facilitators, and firm leadership.

			 - For me personally it resulted in an "outstanding award" for executing a level of responsibility that would typically be for SMs.

		 - Learning
			 - Leadership is a combination of top-down authority and bottom up motivation.

			 - Top-down leadership is not a substitute for genuine relationship building and bottom-up collaboration.

	 - STEP - failure / feedback
		 - H
			 - In my final year Deloitte, after spending $1M+ on a nationwide training program called STEP, for which I was the program manager, we realized that the long term results were not as positive as we had hoped.

		 - C
			 - I led the design and delivery of our first ever large scale training program for 800+ consultants nationwide. I successfully managed a cross-functional team of 12 people and a budget of $1M+.

			 - Although the delivery was successful, and the program was initially deemed to be a success, the feedback 6-months later revealed that the lessons were not being translated from the classroom to real-world projects.

			 - “I learned a lot during STEP, but outside the classroom, my project managers don’t want me to generate hypotheses or to think for myself. They just want me to do as I'm told.”

		 - A
			 - Conducted a retrospective analysis of what went wrong
				 - Managers and senior managers did not feel invested in the program. They were not consulted in the development of this program, only partners and directors had input.

				 - I personally was focused on implementation and execution, but did not think about the high-level mission, goals and objectives of the project. I thought it was not my job to ask these questions, because I'm only responsible for execution.

			 - Plan for next year
				 - Involved all levels of the organization from early on via surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews.

				 - Created an L&D plan that had buy-in from both the top leadership as well as middle-management and ICs.

				 - Surprisingly the actual content of the firm-wide training was not significantly different, but the sense of ownership was significantly higher.

		 - R/L
			 - Securing buy-in from all levels of an organization is crucial to the success of org-wide initiatives. Buy-in from ICs and middle-managers is often more important than securing buy-in from the top leadership.

			 - It's ALWAYS my job to think about the goals and objectives of any project that I'm working on, no matter what my role is.

			 - In my third year at Deloitte, I helped rescue a non-profit project that was at risk of getting de-funded by Deloitte. 

		 - Situation
			 - Deloitte was partnering with a non-profit to improve outcomes for over 100 public schools in one of Hyderabad's school districts, and Deloitte was providing funding of $100k/yr

			 - The project sponsor - one of Deloitte's Managing Directors - was not seeing the outcomes he wanted, and wanted to end the sponsorship

			 - I was asked to evaluate the situation and make a recommendation

		 - Action
			 - Understood objectives
				 - Deloitte MD cared about metrics - improving academic performance and student attendance rates

			 - Understood activities and helped them report
				 - The nonprofit's main objective was to implement school monitoring committees and school development plans to improve community involvement and accountability.

				 - They weren't clearly articulating why this was important, but it turned out that they had the same objectives as the Deloitte sponsor.

				 - They just weren't articulating or measuring the objectives and results

			 - Developed hypotheses to align stakeholders
				 - Implementing SMCs and SDPs will improve the outcome metrics.

				 - Set up a data collection and reporting mechanism - implemented the metrics and a dashboard

		 - Result
			 - Showed that the nonprofit's activities were actually contributing to the metrics the sponsor cared about. The partner was happy with the result and was able to take it back to his stakeholders. Retained funding from Deloitte

		 - Learning
			 - Understand the objectives of all stakeholders.

			 - Implement metrics to capture these objectives and always measure the progress of activities.

			 - Communication and report using the stakeholder's language.

				 - Conflict between event management team and content team on who makes decision.

				 - E.g. Content team

			 - Action
				 - Broke down roles and responsibilities into much greater detail; Clearly identified SPOCs for each area;

				 - got approval from my partner and socialized the plan with the team very early on.

				 - Primary and secondary research. I was assigned to primary.

			 - Action
				 - I didn't know what I was signing up for. I expected to leverage our own internal experts. But the job was all about building new connections and relationships.

				 - Very uncomfortable with sales and cold calling.

				 - My initial approach was very transactional: Deloitte is doing a market study on glass packaging for cosmetics. We need some information from you.

				 - My later approach was more relationship oriented: We would like to understand some of your needs and requirements, and how the industry can better serve you.

			 - Result
				 - Client was pleased with the market study and growth strategy.

				 - Based on the depth of interaction we had with customers, we built individual account plans for key clients.

			 - Learning
				 - Understanding the customer and building relationships

				 - Transactional vs. relationship approach

		 - Minds and machines
			 - Over the past couple of decades there's been a lot of research in behavioral science, particularly in psychology and economics, which reveals the extent to which human judgment is unreliable due to a plethora of heuristics and biases.

			 - We noticed, through our consulting work, that a lot of these insights were starting to percolate into mainstream business management practices and there was a lot of enthusiasm around "taking humans out of the loop" so-to-speak in terms of business forecasting, especially with the rise of big data and business intelligence software.

			 - Although there is a lot of research to suggest that humans are routinely outperformed by even simple algorithms, we wanted to take a closer look at the kinds of scenarios where this makes sense and the limitations of automation with respect to business forecasting.

			 - OPTIONAL: Hyndman
				 - We understand and can measure the causal factors.

				 - There is a lot of historical data available.

				 - The forecasts do not affect the thing we are trying to forecast.

				 - The future will somewhat resemble the past in a relevant way.

	 - Resume
		 - Led a team of 4 analysts and data scientists; used financial theory and statistical data analysis to build an inference and valuation model for damages in a $1B+ litigation alleging market manipulation in foreign exchange (FX) markets

	 - Case study: Fox
		 - Legal context
			 - A group of large multinational banking firms were hit with a class action lawsuit alleging collusion and price fixing in foreign exchange markets.

			 - Over a period of several years, FX traders from various banks were participating in interbank chatrooms where they were sharing pricing information in an alleged conspiracy to fix prices.

			 - As a result of this conduct, plaintiffs were alleging that the entire class of customers who engaged in FX transactions with these banks suffered damages in the form of inflated transaction costs.

		 - Plaintiff report - spreads
			 - We were in the class certification stage, and the plaintiffs had submitted expert reports arguing in favor of class certification.

			 - One report was an analysis of the chat transcripts, in which they were trying to demonstrate that the sharing of sensitive competitive information was pervasive and therefore likely to have class-wide impact.

			 - Common impact: they claimed to have a working model which demonstrates, through common formulae, that virtually all class members suffered damages.

			 - Damage = transaction cost paid - fair transaction cost
				 - transaction cost = price paid - mid-point of bid-ask spread

			 - To measure the "fair transaction cost", they gathered data from a "clean period" after the end of the alleged collusion (after the inter-bank chatrooms were shut down), and built a regression model to predict transaction cost based on a range of control factors such as:
				 - Order characteristics (size, currency pair, platform)

				 - Customer characteristics (trading frequency, sophistication)

				 - Market conditions (time of day, day of month, volatility)

			 - They then applied this model to the class period to predict "fair transaction cost" for class period transactions and calculated damages as the difference between the fair cost and the actual cost.

			 - This led them to conclude that over 99% of class members suffered damages as measured by this model.

		 - Rebuttal - spreads
			 - In the rebuttal, our expert was arguing that this case is not suitable for class-wide analysis, and that pricing is the result of highly individualized negotiations, depending on their personalized relationships and their respective positions.

			 - Two main points: (1) we don't think this is a good model; even if we take the model at face value, it doesn't support plaintiff's argument

			 - Plaintiff's model explains very little of the variation in spreads. Low R2, high RMSE. R2 < 10%. RMSE ~ 10 basis points.
				 - Plaintiff's model predicts that half the transactions suffered damages not only in the class period, but also in the clean period. The model shows false positives in clean period.

			 - Damages are not statistically significant
				 - Over 95% of damages estimates are not significantly different from zero (i.e. the 95%CI includes zero).

				 - Majority of the class members did not have a single trade which suffered damages in a statistically significant sense.

			 - Plaintiff's model suggests that ~25% of class members (and a larger proportion of the named plaintiffs) benefited on a net basis from the alleged conduct.
				 - This also points to the fact that the fx market is not clearly segregated into buyers and sellers.

			 - Exhibits
				 - Trades harmed, class vs. clean

				 - Class members harmed, class vs. clean

				 - Net damages

				 - Trades harmed and class members harmed (statistically significant)

				 - Aggregate damages by class member and defendant bank

		 - Chats
			 - Plaintiffs: chats show that alleged collusion had class-wide impact

			 - Rebuttal
				 - No causal link between any specific chat and any specific trade.

				 - Chats are sparse; occur at a specific time of day, discussing a specific currency pair for a specific customer, in the context of a market that is fluctuating minute by minute.

				 - Only 5-6 chats per day where spread information was shared, in contrast to 300k+ transactions per day.

				 - Breakfast cereal argument:

			 - Exhibits
				 - Currency pairs appearing in chats (spreads related vs. other)
					 - Bar chart and matrix

				 - Volumes discussed in chat transcripts in the context of global fx trading

				 - Workplan for further exhibits and analysis

				 - Percentage of interdealer transactions vs. dealer to customer

		 - Misc
			 - To obtain class certification of a damages claim, plaintiffs are required to demonstrate, among other things, that “questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”

	 - Case study: Cyber
		 - Legal context
			 - There was a consumer-facing firm that was hit with a large scale data breach class action litigation.

			 - The data breach compromised millions of records of customers' personally identifying information such as names, addresses, DOBs, SSNs, etc.

			 - As a result of this data breach, plaintiffs were arguing that the entire class of impacted customers suffered damages in the form of:
				 - Actual injuries due to identity theft (fraudulent credit card transactions, etc.)

				 - Cost of risk mitigation (identity theft protection services, credit monitoring, etc.)

				 - Time spent / loss of productivity in addressing the issues.

		 - Case context
			 - Very early stages. Complaint was filed very recently, and CR just won the project.

			 - Didn't have an expert; didn't even have a team. It was just me and another associate working directly with the principal, trying to lay the groundwork for the upcoming case.

		 - Baseline analysis
			 - Goal: to conduct a baseline analysis of past data breach class actions to set expectations for the client in terms of potential settlement outcomes. I was able to come up with a range of potential settlement figures.

			 - Downloaded list of data breaches
				 - Privacy rights clearing house

				 - Identity Theft Resource Center

				 - Wikipedia

			 - Researched each case for data on number and type of records breached, settlement terms and values, etc.
				 - Court rulings

				 - Settlement notices

				 - Academic papers

				 - Media articles

			 - Made a preliminary estimate of the settlement outcome range, together with a workplan for a more rigorous analysis (from PACER, Westlaw databases, etc.). Based on average settlement value per record breached (SSN vs. no).

			 - Summarized key settlement terms and court rulings.

		 - Internal memos
			 - Goal: to help them get up to speed on key issues

			 - Summary of complaint and plaintiff's theories of harm

			 - Memos on key concepts such as credit freezes, credit monitoring, identity theft, etc.
