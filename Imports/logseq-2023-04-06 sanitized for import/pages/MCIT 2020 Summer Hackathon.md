title: MCIT 2020 Summer Hackathon
---

- Proposal
	 - Summary
		 - Build a machine learning application using the fastai library

	 - About fastai 
		 - The fastai library enables coders without any ML background to create state of the art deep learning models with just a dozen lines of python code: https://docs.fast.ai/

		 - The fast.ai course contains detailed video tutorials on how to use the library to build Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. After just two video lectures you'll be able to build simple CV models from scratch : https://course.fast.ai/

	 - Hackathon project goals
		 - Prerequisite (the week before the hackathon): Watch the first few videos of the fastai course and play around with the fastai library. 

		 - Main project: Use the library to build our own CV / NLP model. Examples of models we could build:
			 - CV model to predict the breed of a cat or dog based on its photograph (you already learn how to do this by the end of the first two lectures).

			 - CV model to predict a person's age based on their photograph.

			 - NLP model to predict the sentiment (positive vs. negative) of reviews or tweets.  

		 - Extra credit: Deploy the model as a flask web application.

	 - About me
		 - Hi, I'm Nikhil! I'm a Product Manager at Adobe, and I'm just wrapping up CIT 593 this semester. I also have some prior background in Python programming, and I'm in the US Pacific time zone: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilmaddirala/

	 - About you
		 - Take a look at the first video of the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/). Does it excite you? If yes, please join my hackathon team! :) I'm looking for 1-2 teammates to join this hackathon team. If your time zone is close to US Pacific Time, that's a bonus (but not required).

	 - Next steps
		 - If you're interested, please reply to this thread by the end of Monday, August 10! I will wait until then so that people have sufficient time to read and respond.

		 - In case too many people are interested, we can form multiple teams of people doing similar projects!
