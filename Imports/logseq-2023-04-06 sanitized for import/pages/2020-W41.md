	 - [[What did I accomplish this week?]]
		 - Got a lot done this week. Work was good, made progress on the QS demos. Coursework was also great. I'm almost current till next October! And I got a lot of little things sorted like finding an immigration attorney, etc.

	 - [[What did I learn this week?]]
		 - Got back into reading. Started with Zeeshan's Marvel comic, and then got into more comics myself. Will continue reading comics and listening to nonfiction audiobooks for now.
