		 - Resist the overachiever
			 - The overachiever tends to say:
				 - 1.) Achieve more

				 - 2.) You're not living up to your potential

				 - 3.) Don't waste time.  Be productive.

				 - 4.) I am your only motivation to succeed.  Without me, you would never do anything.

				 - 5.) I will concede that the last 18 million times I have told you this it has been repetitive dumb thinking, but __this time it's real__.
