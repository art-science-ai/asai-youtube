        - Meta for 4 years; prior to that Google Brain ML; focus on privacy focused ML

        - Role is Privacy area TL for data minimization and PETs

        - Focus on anon standard, took over from Subodh Iyengar (Subodh is now area lead across multiple privacy areas)

        - Anon tech - making it more pragmatic; 

        - De-ID positions - how is this related to anonymization? Developing a spectrum risk based approach, low to high

            - De-ID

            - A&D

            - Anonymization

    - Intersection of Ananth's role with me

        - Monetization privacy (Steph) in drivers seat when issues is not around data minimization - e.g. transparency requirements, etc.

        - Data min includes De-ID, A&D, Anon, etc.
        

        - If data minimization comes into the picture, then Ananth is pulled in

    - For WAIST, we need SOME transparency but very limited

        - Steph is doing a similar change for 2 yr retention extension - needed user facing transparecy - Nathan Davis asked for it

        - For pragmatic anonymization, if we're extending

    - Attributed data cohort features

        - WAIST talks about the ad click only if the feature is prominent

        - WAIST only looks at sparse user level features

        - Sparse cohort features are not even in WAIST

        - Steph doesn't want to expose anything in WAIST if possible

        - We can just rely on anonymization - doesn't need transparency 

    - Empirical DP for unattributed

        - Defense for attributed was transparency - but we didn't build the tie-ins

        - Jenny, Steph, and Ananth are sold on Empirical DP as the test for unattributed

    - Legal - Josh Gluck - wants to talk about transparency

        - Currently - only in privacy policy and in ad preferences control

    - He networked with a bunch of TPMs who were going through PM hiring
