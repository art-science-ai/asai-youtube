    - Outreach for SAIL

        - Hi <<NAME>>, <<NAME>>, Our Signal Growth Ranking AI team is developing our strategy and roadmap for cross-team collaborations, and we'd love to partner with you to explore collaboration opportunities with <<PRODUCT NAME>>. 
        
        Over the past two years our team has delivered significant iRev on CoreML models by developing AI/ML innovations tailored to Signal Growth specific problems such as data loss, privacy enhanced data usage, and data gain from new sources such as 1PD [A]. Some examples include Privacy Preserving ML (PPML) for leveraging opt-out 3PD as labels and features and Polysource Sparse Machine Learning (PSML) for leveraging new sources of data such as 1PD conversion signals.
        
        Our goal is to leverage these technologies to benefit other ads products that are facing similar data issues. We would love to partner with you to better understand the challenges your team is facing and collaboratively customize our AI/ML solutions to solve these challenges.
        
        As a next step, could you please loop in the relevant stakeholders from your side (TLs, EM, PM) and we can set up a meeting to discuss further.

        - Hi Anusha, Nithinchandra, we are developing the strategy and roadmap for using 1PD high value signals in Ads applications and wanted to explore potential collaborations for 2024. I have spoken to Anusha offline and setup some time tomorrow to go over our strategy doc [A] and and discuss potential opportunities to improve ads quality models through these signals and ML/AI tech. Please feel free to loop in any other POCs we may have missed and let us know if this time doesn't work for you!

- [[../Pages/Semantic Ranking]] product review w [[../Pages/Tak Yan]] [[../Pages/Zhen Chen]]

    - Agenda

        - Goal of review - table of contents

        - Context and vision

            - SGRAI - 3 tracks

        - Zhirong - anything to add?

    - Notes

        - Junbiao's GenAI team working on expanding sources of data - online, offline, multimodal, etc.; they are thinking of it as platform for various teams to use; develop a unified understanding across use cases

        - Maxime - map out relationship between AI4Ads and Semantic Ranking projects

        - Fan - what capabilities do we need to build to support exploration

        - Marvin: how to figure out most important directions as quickly as possible; quickly validate ideas

        - Yiping - talk specifically about signal growth unique challenges and opportunities

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Maxime Boucher]]

    - Semantic ranking feedback

        - How is this related to AI4Ads bets? Simplify it and say it's an application area.

    - 3/11 review

        - Pre-read w Vishal + Minghao

    - MDS doc

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Marvin Kim]]

    - Make it more like a strategy doc

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Jae-woo]]

    - About Jae-woo

        - Meta for 1 yr; formerly Wayfair

        - Part of his team works on ATOM; dedicated focus on productionization 

        - Part of his team works to model sustainability - solving divergence

    - About Alireza + Bo org - 

        - Alireza - focus on ML new techniques in production

        - Bo - goal is to advance SOTA
        

        - Wenlin - modeling

        - Sri - features

    - Semantic Ranking

        - ATOM 

            - Take an ad - we have raw text images etc. - now map it into n-dimensional space or embedding to represent the ad

            - It could be a single ad, or it could be a sequence of ads

            - Tech from Bo's org; we are productionizing it

        - ATOM builds on top of other tech

            - Information tokenization - Austin developed

            - MARS - image version of tokenizer - Yiping's team developed

            - Quantization method - RQVAE

            - FMCU

        - SG specific problem - label loss

            - We don't know what converted and not

            - Cohorting is also possible; mapping users to embedding spaces

            - Non-SG side doesn't care about the other 3p data sets because quality is low; e.g. catalog data
