        Hi Natalia! Following up on our [discussion here](https://fb.workplace.com/chat/t/6515425425234270/?mid=mid.%24gABclvrIIGV6UlxxZz2OZdb_T0V5k), I'd love to partner with you on Shops Ads x Ads Ranking collab opportunities. Setting up time for an intro meeting.

- 1-1 [[../Pages/Marvin Kim]]

    - Decision vs. LAMA

        - Decisions are things we've aligned with leadership team and made a choice

        - LAMA is a downstream process for paperwork; sometimes we are advised not to put certain text on company strategy into LAMA

    - MDS doc writing strategy

        - Each XFN should be able to review this doc with their leads

        - Put in "Nikhil's comments"

- 1-1 w [[../Pages/Maxime Boucher]]

    - Model to predict cohort; input is 1PD; output is 3PD events; one side we get representation of Alice's behavior, and on other side we get an embedding

    - We get embeddings and ads for clustering

    - Model trained with 3pd attributed / unattributed data as labels

- [[../Pages/Therapy]] w [[../Pages/Joseph Lee]]

    - Types of tasks I tend to [[../Pages/Procrastination]]

        - Complex and ambiguous

        - Negative feelings associated with the project or person

    - Feelings involved

        - Unpleasant feelings of "not wanting to do it" / anxiety / dread

        - The unpleasant feelings increase as I procrastinate the task, and they decrease as I make progress on the task

    - Pomodoro tactics

        - Implement rewards and breaks for completing pomodoro - reward needs to be otherwise restricted

        - Shorter pomodoros - just 5 mins

        - Randomize task choice - good for shorter pomodoros

        - Do a 5x5 pomodoro block with 5 mins x 5 tasks = 25 mins
