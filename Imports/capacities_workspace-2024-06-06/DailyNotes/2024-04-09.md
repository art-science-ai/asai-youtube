    - [[../Pages/Meta PM team matching]] initiative

        - Hey, hope you're doing well! I'm a PM looking for org contribution initiatives I can contribute to in the recruiting and onboarding space, and I was wondering if there are any opportunities in the team matching initiative listed in Row 24 of this sheet [A] where you are listed as a POC? Looks like the primary POC (Vinay Ramani) is no longer a Meta employee, so I'm not sure if this is an active project.

    - Upstream model

        - Lot of overlap w 3PD features + upstream model - working on feature part

        - Also working on how to improve current upstream model - improving arch; currently we are just adding 3PD features directly into the model; we can also build EBF

    - Current ranking model arch

        - Dense arch - for dense features

        - Sparse arch - for sparse features - not very efficient, because it's generating new embeddings every time

        - EBF transformer arch will supersede dense and sparse arch; it will process EBFs into embeddings

        - Overarch for dense - sparse - ebf interaction arch

    - Embeddings for clustering

        - Need not be SUM embeddings - can be from other models

        - Could just use AggID labels, need not use 3pd features

        - Recruiter said it would take 1 month to match

        - Had several Meta team matching conversations; 2 HMs expressed interest - Shops Ads, and Central Products (data analytics)

            - Shops Ads - creating integrations with companies for Shops; went with internal candidate

            - Central Products data analytics - experiment platform for A/B test; HM was positive but 3 weeks ago and didn't hear back

        - Has been talking to other PMs who are stuck on team matching and concluded that own networking is a good option

    - Process

        - Candidate portal for approved candidates; HMs express interest in profiles; then HM sets up call and determines how to move forward

        - Profile stays active for 12 months; else re-interview

    - Questions

        - How to navigate conversations with PMs for networking

        - How to navigate conversations with HMs and XFNs
