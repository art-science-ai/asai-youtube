    - Empirical DP

        - Run a test vs holdout group

        - Model accuracy for test group vs. hold-out group

        - If there is a clear difference between test vs. hold-out group then we fail the test

        - If we're not passing the test then it's due to memorization - we have techniques to mitigate; e.g. dropouts for generalization

        - K=5 may be unlikely to pass empirical DP; may need to 

        - How does it work for features?

        - Challenges for ATT

            - We cannot use DPO for holdout - we need a new

    - Feedback

        - I'm driving a lot more clarity on MDS - very helpful

        - Need to simplify options for PXFN understanding

    - Need more internal alignment to narrow down options

        - Can we merge 3 & 4 somehow?

    - List pre-alignment questions

        - Using unattributable data for building cohorts?

    - What is empirical DP according to Maxime?

        - Either it passes or we stop serving - it's binary

    - Intro

        - At Meta on and off 8 yrs

        - Was part of recruiting then moved to leadership role in PM + TPM

    - Team matching process

        - No more bootcamp

        - PIDs have not activated; teams have not activated their headcount; reminder went out to managers to activate it

        - Until they activate it, recruiters don't know that it's activated

        - There is a candidate share group where packets are shared - managers need to go to the group

    - What's causing problems

        - We had a lot of influx of PMs from TPMs from other orgs that were being let go; lot of internal candidates

        - Give a role couple of weeks internally before opening up externally

    - Challenges

        - PIDs not being activated

        - No interest being expressed from manager side for candidates; teams usually don't get engaged in hiring till Q1

        - Aram: Candidates reaching out externally due to lack of engagement

        - People had to directly ping managers - migr

        - Approved levels are not shared with HMs - should be now fixed

    - Potential solutions

        - Migrating to eng process for team matching

            - Eng is a much larger org; previously eng also followed PM process of informal 1-1 calls between HM and candidate; shifted to war room process where senior leads looked through all the packets and then made hiring decision

        - Ensuring that all managers get onboarded to the new hire group

    - Tell new HMs not to search externally 

        - Instead

    - PM + Org

        - Elizabeth's manager - Diana etc. reaching out and having conversations with business partners

        - Matt Lebanc is the other person

    - Discussed list of overall problems

        - OCPD

        - ADHD

        - Alcohol

        - Relationships - parents etc.

    - Alcohol and binge drinking

        - Why am I engaging in this behavior?

            - Finding release from rigidity of OCPD

            - Learned behavior from college: associated it with positive experiences from college; established neural pathways

        - When I try to use the timer method, part of my brain with learned behavior takes over

    - Strategies and tools for drinking - discuss next time
