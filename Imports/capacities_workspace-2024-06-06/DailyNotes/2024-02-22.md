    - Interview training

        I got an email saying "You are ready for the next step in interview training", but when I go to interview training intern page https://www.internalfb.com/intern/recruiting/interview/training it says "You are not yet eligible to start training". Any idea what I need to do? Thanks in advance! 😊

    - DS POC for 1PD HVS Ads Score attribution

        Hey Harold! One ask from the 1PD HVS team is to have a DS POC who will be responsible for consuming matercook pre-test / back-test results and translating them to proposal and signal level iRev attribution.  

    - IG follow-up

        I started strength training in general about 6 months ago, and I started learning the olympic lifts (snatch and clean & jerk in the video) 1 month ago.

    - Ranking unattributed

        - We are opening up a lot of data usage - should be open season for ML mitigations

        - Leverage TETRIS to ship even more mitigations

        - We know the feature headroom, but we don't know about new innovations and what value they could add

        - Opportunity size can be even more than headroom

    - [[../Pages/ML data retention extension]]

        - OBA opt out anonymized data doesn't have standardized retention

        - Retention is correlated to noise level - that's how DP noise algorithm works; that is now changing due to UCAA, so we can extend longer to 90 days - work with [[../Pages/Kash Patel]] on UCAA

        - We need SoT doc on principles to determine retention periods

            - What about scenarios where we are not using DP noise like in calibration, QRT, etc.? We want to push that to 2y as well.

        - Need this sign-off in the next month or two
