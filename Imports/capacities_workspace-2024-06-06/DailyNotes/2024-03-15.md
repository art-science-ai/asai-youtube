    - Features

        - Content feature vs. sequence feature distinction doesn't make sense; clarify

        - Relationship w/ AI4Ads projects on content understanding - COIN, etc.

    - Modeling

        - What's the relationship between the various directions (LLM fine-tuning vs. in-house model)?

        - Which direction is most important or which is the bottleneck?
