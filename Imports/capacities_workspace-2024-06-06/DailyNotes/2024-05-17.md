    - Notes from Koren

        - Try to not form an immediate opinion; write up the notes and then evaluate

        - Select questions and stick with them for many interviews

        - Candidate seems junior - maybe that's why he's not that good at stakeholder feedback and development

    - Qs for Koren

        - How do you select the questions and the probes?

        - What's the purpose of the initial questions on why Meta?

    - Overall feedback

        - Talks too long; too much context

        - Often not very specific even when probed

    - Taking Ownership and Accountability

        - Project that failed; probe: how did you learn this; how to avoid in future

            - Answers are very long

            - Notes

                - Few days away from launch, realized second order negative impact

                - Missed the second order impact due to tunnel vision focus on launch and lack of due diligence

                - Not clear on learnings

    - Driving Resourcefulness and Results

        - Rallied team to deliver something that others were skeptical of

            - Mobile app offers feature with poor performance

    - Growing Continuously: Difficult feedback; probe: walk through conversations

        - After important presentation, got feedback from manager that the analytics content was not great even through he thought he already aligned with the manager

        - Talked to manager and understood that he didn't communicate clearly on what he thought was aligned

        - Talked to analytics team and learned about things he did wrong

        - Learned to communicate clearly upfront with all stakeholders; learned to present clearly

    - Growing continuously: development areas; probe: clear communication vs. visioning

        - Long term alignment with high level leadership

        - Unclear on how he's resolving that

    - Resolving Conflict: Difficult working relationship

        - Partner PM; thought he aligned with leads on roles and responsibilities; built a joint roadmap, but partner PM later came back with a completely different roadmap
