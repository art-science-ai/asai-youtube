    - [[../Pages/Weightlifting]] program

        - My current olympic weightlifting program is 3x / week where each day includes an olympic lift (either the snatch or the clean and jerk) followed by accessories like squat, press, clean, etc. I now want to split my program between my home gym (2x / week) and my weightlifting gym (2x / week) such that I do the olympic lifts at my weightlifting gym and the accessories at my home gym. Given that I can only do the olympic lifts 2x / week I'm wondering whether I should split that into one Snatch day and one Clean & Jerk day? Or should I do the Snatch followed by Clean & Jerk on both days?

    - Ensure that anonymization is covering the whole flow, then we don't need Empirical DP on teacher model

    - Cohort generation - using 1PD features and model to predict

    - Q: How can we use event data?

        - We go through anonymization processing before using event level data

    - Jason Q: Use of group membership

        - Alice part of some specific group; we know that she is likely to have breast cancer because of this group membership

        - Jason: Group membership cannot be used for targeting

        - Maxime: we have existing mitigations for sensitive data - those are already in place

        - Brett: Ensure that cohort generation process is not bypassing sensitive data mitigations (SUM v4 onwards are compliant, but not older versions) - talk to Tobias and May

    - Adversarial risk

        - E.g. model will not learn single user behavior - need mitigation for this

        - Journalist cannot recreate this scenario

        - Adversarial example: new person on our platform, no 1PD - in this case model doesn't learn behavior

        - WAIST: similar activity to other users

        - Brett eg. - couple living together; one opt-out one opt-in; only 1PD engagement is friending; if ad is shown to one based on

- ATT ML Data Retention

    - SNA revocation data clean-up is a general problem across the board

    - Brett: we are at the intersection of competing policies

        - User data deletion policy - is ATT out data considered user data?

        - We have commitment risks related to ATT-out data

    - Steph: nothing really restricting our data retention for 90 vs 720 days, but need to list every single policy

    - Revocation and deletion requirements

        - SNA revocation

        - User data deletion policy

        - For some of them the enforcement policy would not be possible to meet

        - ATT out data needs to become resilient to User Data Deletion Policies (UDDPs)
