        - performance issues (we're not delivering results to advertisers); e.g. some campaigns stop spending before budget ends because we're not able to hit ROAS targets

        - Product gaps: only support purchase GMV, want to support LTV etc. expand event types, channels, attribution, etc.

    - Opportunity area: Feature

        - Their feature engineering is not up to date with CoreML etc.

        - They have good coverage on advertiser features, but poor coverage on user features
