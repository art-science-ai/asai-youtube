### Lease renewal 2025
Zestimate: $5,725/mo



Hi Equity Lease Team,

Thank you for sharing the lease renewal offer. We've really enjoyed living here over the past two years and would love to continue living here, but the proposed increase is worrying. The new subtotal of $6,326.60 reflects a ~9% rise, which just below the legal maximum of 10%. While we understand that operating costs may have risen, this level of increase is difficult to absorb, especially considering broader market trends and local income growth.

We’d like to propose a more moderate adjustment, in the range of 2–3%, which would bring the subtotal to around $5,950 per month (rent + parking). We believe this strikes a fair balance and reflects the goodwill we've built as tenants who have always payed on time, cared for the unit, and raised any issues constructively.

We sincerely hope to reach an agreement that works for both sides and allows us to remain part of this community.

Thank you for your consideration,
Nikhil and Rukma
