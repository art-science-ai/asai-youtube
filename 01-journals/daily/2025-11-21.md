	- Next steps
		- Give me a deep dive demo of one of your past projects, including:
			- Analysis that was delivered to the client
			- Scenario planning web app that was delivered to the client
		- Then I can build a demo AI Agent for you focusing on that example project
	- Message to Kamal + Balaji
		- Had a good call with Balaji today on building an AI Agent for pricing analysis scenario planning. What I would request as a next step (whenever you're ready) is a deep-dive walkthrough of one example project end to end so that I can understand the workflow in detail. Then I can come back to you with a more concrete proposal on how I could build a demo AI agent for your use case!
