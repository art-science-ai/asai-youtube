	- AI for Experimentation (AI4E) agents are improving experimentation velocity for experiments across Meta. We are currently in alpha, with our agents only exposed to <10% of the user base behind GKs, and we have already assisted 500+ unique users with 1500+ experiments, i.e., 10% of experiments across Meta. As we scale up and open up access to GKs, we are aiming to assist 30% of experiments across Meta by the end of 2025.
