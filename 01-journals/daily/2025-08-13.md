# Misc
#### [[nix]] meetup follow-ups
It was great meeting so many Nix enthusiasts at yesterday's meetup - thank you Ron and Farid for organizing! 

I volunteered to host the next one (potentially the next one). Questions:

- When's a good time for the next meetup?
- If we want to make this a regular series, what cadence do we want? E.g. one a month vs. once every two months

We also have Jeremy's meetup at Berkeley on the first Friday of every month, and I was wondering how we want to handle both? Here are some options to consider:

A: Two meetups every month. First Friday in Berkeley and another day in the Peninsula 

B: Alternate monthly meetups between Berkeley and Peninsula

C: Berkeley and Peninsula meetups keep separate schedules.
