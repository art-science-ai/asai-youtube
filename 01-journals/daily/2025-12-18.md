- Call w Sejal
	- Statistical analysis role
	- Results file also gives RPI curve as output
	- PPT charts - screenshots - HP brown sauce
	- p2 - executive summary
	- p3 - d0 (predefined structure)
		- pivot table on d0 - screenshot from d0
		- Includes narrative
	- p. 4 - historical analysis - only for repeat clients where we did last year
	- p5-6 - brand x channel
	- p. 5 - 
		- chart generation - manual
		- source data is just results 
		- currently being automated by scenario planner
		- Narrative writing - manual - potential for automation -- cross check with EDA
	- p.6
		- Results file also generates RPI file 
		- RPI curve - open in power bi - gives the chart
		- Take the screenshot and add annotation
		- Decide charts 
	- 7-8 : one channel (supermarket) breakdown
	- 9-10: one channel (tesco)
	- 11-12: one channel (iceland)
	- 13-14: one channel (convenience)
	- 
	- p 7 - further breakdown of slide 5
	- p 9 - breakdown of slide 5
	- p 10 - rpi again
	- p11 - breakdown
	- Ohter notes
		- Need RPI curve to interpret how much you can increase the price - you can incrase until MSP = 0

## Notes
Scope of project depends on num of chanels and brands

- Average case = Usually 3-4 channels + Each channel has 5-6 brands
- Sometimes we have variants in the scope, that will increase the time
