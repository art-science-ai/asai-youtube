- [[Zen Browser]] shortcuts
	- Zen browser > settings > look and feel > we can select between three layouts: "only sidebar", "sidebar and top bar", "collapsed sidebar"
	- I want to make a keyboard shortcut to toggle between these three layouts
	- Zen has shortcuts for "toggle floating sidebar" and "toggle compact mode"
