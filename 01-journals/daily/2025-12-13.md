## Notes
Hi Vaishnavi, sorry for the delay on the mosquito mesh - here's what I'm thinking: For the front door and kitchen door I'd like to have a door style mosquito mesh (not a sliding screen) with an auto door closer. 

Without an auto door closer, I've noticed that half the time people will just leave the mosquito screen open, which defeats its entire purpose. It's difficult to change human behavior, so I find technologies like door closers are super helpful for this!

As you may be aware - we ran into some problems with the door closer at Nagarjuna Hills and we're still waiting for a new one to be installed. I was hoping to test that out before confirming the same requirement for the new apartment. Could you please look into this?

Mosquito mesh experience at Nagarjuna Hills:

- They installed the mosquito mesh door around Nov 3. I was very happy with the quality of the door, but they said they needed few more days for the door closer.
- About a week later (around Nov 10) they installed the door closer. But the door closer they installed was too powerful for the door. This resulted in the door closing at a very high velocity and creating a very loud noise every time it was closed. I requested them to do two things: (1) order a new door closer that is less powerful, and (2) implement some interim solution to dampen the sound like an adhesive gasket tape between the door and frame. They agreed to do both, but despite multiple follow-ups they did neither.
