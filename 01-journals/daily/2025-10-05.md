### Notes
```
Opencode puts your config in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (e.g. ~/.config/) and your data in $XDG_DATA_HOME (e.g. ~/.local/share/) and everything is neatly organized. 

Claude Code dumps literally everything into a giant mess of a ~/.claude.json file. Okay, they recently started moving things into a monolithic ~/.claude/ but AFAIK the global MCP servers can only be specified in ~/.claude.json
