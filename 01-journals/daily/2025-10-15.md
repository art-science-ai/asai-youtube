	- Hi Arvind uncle, this is Nikhil (Dr. Subrahmanyam's son). Hope you're doing well! 😊 I'm looking for a maternity photoshoot for me and my wife Rukma this Saturday at our home in Panjagutta. It should be a pretty quick session of approx 30 minutes. Please let me know if you are available. Thank you!
