# Discovery process

## Overview

The discovery process transforms client conversations into well-structured proposals through a systematic extraction and synthesis workflow.

## Process

1. Conduct discovery calls
   - Schedule one or more calls with prospective client
   - Prepare discussion guide (optional)
   - Record each conversation

2. Transcribe each call
   - Use `tools/transcription/` to transcribe the recording
   - Review transcript for accuracy

3. Create transcript summaries
   - Use `templates/transcript-summary-template.md` to structure key information from each call
   - Extract client context, pain points, goals, constraints
   - Save each summary in project/client folder

4. Develop proposal
   - Synthesize all transcript summaries into a single proposal document
   - Frame the problem and opportunity in client's language
   - Develop proposed solution and pricing
   - Present to client

## Templates

- `templates/transcript-summary-template.md` - Use this to extract structured information from each transcript
- `templates/proposal-template.md` - Use this to synthesize transcript summaries into a client proposal
