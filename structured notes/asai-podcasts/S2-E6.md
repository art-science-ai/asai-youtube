# Episode Transcript
Nikhil Maddirala (00:10)
Hey, welcome to the Art and Science of AI, a podcast about the science of how AI works and the art of using AI to reimagine your life, business, and society. I'm Nikhil. I'm one of your co -hosts. I'm an AI product manager, and I love talking about AI.

Piyush (00:29)
I'm Piyush, your other co -host and I too love talking about AI and we're two best friends who love talking about AI with each other. Nikhil, you know, one thing that has been terrifying me ever since like the modern AI has blown up over the last two years is the prospect of AI leading to mass unemployment. and by mass unemployment, mean, literally

all jobs will be taken over by AI except for a handful few, right? Like maybe 0 .1 % of jobs will remain. And the reason it worries me is personally, it worries me because how am my wife and I gonna provide for our family? But it also worries me with regards to my daughter, right? Like I don't know what I should be preparing my daughter. And I imagine this is a question that a lot of parents are asking themselves.

How should they be preparing their children for the future where the future is just so uncertain? So what I want to talk about today is how much truth is there to this fear that AI can potentially lead to the kind of mass unemployment that I'm worrying about. Similar to, know, how we kind of unpacked in the AI hype cycle episode, like how much truth is there behind the hype of AI? Like I want to unpack, like how much truth is there behind

Nikhil Maddirala (01:43)
Mm -hmm

Piyush (01:50)
fear that I do have about AI leading to mass unemployment.

Nikhil Maddirala (01:56)
Yeah, I think that's a good question. It's probably a bit harder to unpack than the previous question about AI hype because

This is more about long -term trends that we still don't know about. But maybe we can look to some historical examples as a guide and think about some other large -scale revolutions that happened in history, such as the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s and the advent of personal computers in the 1990s and look at what kind of transformations they brought about in society. And then we can think

Okay, like so how do we apply that now today? What's similar to that? How is it different with the AI revolution? And I know that there are a bunch of there's arguments on both sides if you've been following this debate There are a lot of people that are on one extreme side of it They're saying this time is going to be very different than any of the past examples and it's just so radically different that There will be you know total loss of all jobs and then there are some people that

like, well, this is not at all different from what's happened in the past. It's just gonna repeat. I would guess the truth is maybe somewhere in between the two. I don't know. That would just be my guess. But let's talk it through. Let's look at some examples from the past and then let's see what's going on today and in what ways it's similar and different. Does that sound good?

Piyush (03:27)
Yeah, let's take that approach.

Nikhil Maddirala (03:29)
So one of the first times I think like we had seen large scale shifts in the labor force was in during the industrial revolution, like in the 17 and 1800s in Europe when for the first time machinery and automation was introduced into the manufacturing process. And until then people did almost everything through manual labor. So in what are some examples of this? Let's take two simple examples like

agriculture and making goods like let's say textiles, clothing. So previously these two things were done purely by hand. Like there were artisans who did it using handcrafted tools, just purely with manual labor. And then with the industrial revolution, there was machinery that could do these tasks or not do it completely, but it really sped up and automated a lot of these processes.

Piyush (04:28)
improve the productivity dramatically

Nikhil Maddirala (04:30)
Yeah, dramatically improve the productivity and...

So I think in those kind of cases, there are a couple of shifts that happen, two major ones. So one is that jobs were lost in the sense that, say you had a farm and you needed 100 manual laborers to work on that farm. You no longer needed 100 manual laborers with machinery. Maybe you needed, in the beginning, it was like 50 and then later it dropped to like 25 and then

dropped to 10. And this is actually a trend you can see, for example, if you look at the percentage of the global population that is engaged in agriculture, for most of human history, that was like a very high figure, maybe like more than 50 % of the world's population was doing agriculture. Today, if you look at what percentage of the global population is doing agriculture, I think it's less than 10%. It might even be much smaller, it's very small, but

Still, we have the same amount of food. In fact, we have more food. We have an abundance of food today compared to pre -industrial era. So we got mass increase in productivity, a lot more output for like a lot less number of people that are involved in creating that output. So that's one thing that is undeniable. Some jobs are just going to go away or there will be a much less need for them.

And then, but on the other hand, you also have to think about job creation. There are so many like new jobs that emerged that didn't exist before, such as, you know, maybe you had like operators of these machines, you had people who had to actually manufacture these machines, and this created whole new industries and jobs that like didn't exist before. So on net,

I think in the short term there was like a lot of social upheaval and it took a lot of time for society to adjust but like on net balance what happened I think was a positive force like today we look back upon the Industrial Revolution and we think of it as one of the great advances in human history. So maybe that's one example we can start with and think about the factors that we talked about. So one is there's loss of

jobs but there's also creation of new jobs and new industries and the other thing is like transformation of jobs so what this job was before has now become something else like to be someone that say to be an agricultural worker previously involved doing a lot of manual labor but then that job transformed into being someone who knows how to work with the right equipment and machinery

to get the job done. So, yeah.

Piyush (07:32)
Yeah. Yeah. I abstract out what you're saying is the kind of jobs that were lost were jobs that depended on physical power of humans that machinery replaced and the new types of jobs that were created were more reliant on the intellectual power of humans, which the agriculture revolution, the machinery that we had could not replace,

I think if I take the argument of the camp that's saying that this time it's different is we not only have we made a lot of progress in the physical aspect, like robotics and whatnot, that it continues to replace the physical power of humans. But this time what we're doing is we're creating a technology that is like open AI's stated goal is to build AGI, right? Which is artificial general intelligence, which by implication means

Nikhil Maddirala (08:27)
Mm -hmm.

Piyush (08:29)
It's a generally thinking thing which can replace almost all types of intellectual capacity jobs that we have as humans. So like you already have this curve of physical power being replaced ever since industrial revolution and more advanced robotics. But now on top of that, we also have a cognitive power being replaced with more modern AI, like which can replace almost all types of intellectual capacities.

So we have our physical power, we have our cognitive power. What else remains? Like there's nothing else to be taken away. I think that's my worry. And which is why I fight myself in the camp of this time it's different. I'm curious, like what is your, yeah.

Nikhil Maddirala (09:02)
Yeah.

Okay, that makes sense. I think that's a reasonable argument. Before getting to AI, let's look

The second revolution that happened that actually touches upon some of this cognitive aspect that you're talking about, which is the computer revolution and more specifically the personal computer revolution. This happened in the early 1990s. So, you know, before that there were just these mainframe computers like IBM mainframes. And there's a famous quote from the leader of IBM at the time that he thought in the entire world there's a need for something like just only a handful of computers. That's what he

Piyush (09:47)
See you.

Nikhil Maddirala (09:47)
thought that the need for computers wasn't in the world. And because he thought of them as these big clunky machines that only like big offices and governments and corporations could have. But yeah, in the 90s, because of innovations from companies like Microsoft and Apple specifically, because of these two companies, we saw like just a proliferation of personal computers. And that had similar effects also, where think about just a simple

like a spreadsheet. So this was actually one of the first applications of personal computer, just spreadsheets like Excel. I think back then it was called Lotus 1, 2, 3 or I don't actually know what was.

Piyush (10:27)
Lotus notes.

Nikhil Maddirala (10:29)
Yeah, maybe one of the early spreadsheet programs. So, and think of the kind of professions that were impacted by that, like accountants. So prior to, the advent of spreadsheets, if you needed to do something simple, like your own personal taxes or computing a company's financial statements, this all had to be done by hand. So you would have all of your inputs and assumptions, and then you would do all these calculations by hand and come

with the outputs and suddenly with a tool like a spreadsheet you're able to just do that in one click. Something that took you probably like hours is now taking you minutes. This is I think a good example of what you are calling intellectual work because you know doing calculations, mathematics, that's intellectual work and that got automated by computers. Some other examples would

things

just like writing, typing and things like that, they became like much easier to do. Previously, you would have to spend a long time like writing up memos and then maybe or often people had secretaries whose entire job was to like take voice notes from their boss and like transcribe them in a memo and they even had skills like shorthand and things to make this easy. yeah, basic examples of like cognitive or intellectual types

tasks, they got automated. again, we saw similar kind of impacts, I think, where the number of people that was needed, that were needed for these types of roles, it shrank significantly. But on the other side, what happened is there's also job creation, it created a whole new set of jobs. So jobs like software developer that really didn't exist before that, because we didn't have software. And

It's one of the most popular and in -demand occupations in the world. So at the same time as technology killing or shrinking a lot of jobs it created a whole new set of possibilities and that's because it it created value it created new types of experiences that people want to enjoy Like, you know people want to play computer games that that's a thing that just didn't exist and now there are software developers who specialize in making games so

Yeah, maybe let's think about that. Here's another example where you have again, both opposing trends. There's like shrinking of jobs, but there's also expansion of new types of jobs.

Piyush (13:14)
Yeah, no, think that is a very good point. if again abstract or what you're saying is, yes, we have had two instances of two revolutions in the past where a lot of jobs were eliminated, but a lot of new jobs were birthed or created that is just that would have been impossible to anticipate from the point of view of the old economy or the old system. Right. Like, for example, computer games could not have been anticipated.

Nikhil Maddirala (13:42)
Yeah.

Piyush (13:43)
pre -industrial revolution, right? So similarly with this whole AI revolution, perhaps there will be new type of jobs that our minds just cannot comprehend or anticipate right now. Cause what AI will lead to will be a fundamentally different world with its fundamentally different types of ecosystems and it will require a new type of job. So I think that's a good point. And that's because it depends on the unpredictability.

Nikhil Maddirala (13:58)
Mm -hmm.

Mm -hmm

Piyush (14:09)
of what that new ecosystem will be that informs new jobs is just hard to speculate, right? So we can just take that argument that maybe that's what's going to happen again. But

Nikhil Maddirala (14:19)
And we can see this in our own lifetime. I mean, not in my lifetime, but in our families. people have grandparents. I have grandparents, you have grandparents, and

Most of our grandparents, like they were born, I don't know, my grandparents were born in the 1930s and when they were growing up, like this was totally pre computers. And if you told them that, there's going to be one of the biggest jobs in future is going to be software developer. They'd be like, what the hell are you talking about? This doesn't make sense to me. And so, yeah, and I think it's fundamentally because we're the technology and the advancements are leading

Piyush (14:40)
Right.

Yeah. Yeah.

Nikhil Maddirala (15:00)
to new types of experiences that human beings want and that's creating extra value. So then the people who are able to create those kinds of experiences are able to capture that value by their work in these jobs. So making a computer game is an example or there are even some fundamental human needs like communication, for example, that's like a fundamental human need. And that is, you know, with the advances of like video calls, text messaging, like

these kind of things, they're filling fundamental human needs in new and innovative ways so people who are enabling that are able to capture value from that.

Piyush (15:41)
Yeah, I think, I think that's an excellent point. And I think like you clearly laid out, there is historical precedence for that to happen during two revolutions, two big revolutions. So it's quite possible that it may happen again. If I go back to wearing my, this time it's different hat. The way I think about this is in all of those instances where new jobs were created, there was a need for a new job.

Nikhil Maddirala (15:58)
Yeah.

Piyush (16:10)
And we didn't have technology that could do that job, which is why humans had to fill in that role and then do that job. So it wasn't like, we need humans to be engaged in some productive activity. So let's create this new job profile for them. It was more organically. We had a need for a certain desire or certain need to be fulfilled. And humans took that job because it couldn't have been done with technology. in this time, it might be different is

whatever that new job will be, again, it's hard to anticipate, right? Cause it'll be so fundamentally different. It's like, did any pre -industrial revolution person could even understand what a graphic animator or a digital animator is? No, like animation itself didn't exist before Walt Disney created Disney, right? So it's just, can even, our minds can't even comprehend what that new job will be. However, I go back to

Nikhil Maddirala (16:41)
Mm -hmm.

Yeah.

Piyush (17:05)
OpenAI stated goal is artificial general intelligence, right? What that means is there will be an entity and a lot of people are predicting that that entity will be here maybe in the next five years, 10 years, even the most conservative people are like within 20 years, we should have some kind of AGI. So when you have a situation when there is an entity which is far more intelligent than human beings, then could there be a job that this entity will not be able to

Like that's my question is like, no matter what that new thing is, however radically different it is and my mind can't comprehend it. But what I can predict is we're building a technology that can do whatever we can, if not better than we can. So whatever it is, that technology will do it for us. So what will we be required for?

Nikhil Maddirala (17:36)
Hmm. Yeah.

Yeah, that's a good point. think so. One thing that's emerging is that your view on unemployment due to AI is going to be strongly connected to your view on the possibility of AGI and how strong that will be and how soon.

that will emerge. And of course, like nobody knows that yet. What AGI will look like and how soon it will come about or actually like how general and how intelligent it will be. But I think one thing we can look at is so you are saying that things like graphic design, computer game development, we couldn't even think of in the past as like these are needs that would come up. We can maybe anchor some of these things to some enduring

human needs that are just expressed and realized in different ways. So in this case, I would say things like, say communication and entertainment. Okay, these are two like fundamental human needs that have been there since the dawn of history. And that's gone through different evolutions like communication originally required either just only in person or you have to travel somewhere and then we invented

Piyush (18:43)
We do.

Nikhil Maddirala (19:08)
The postal system and the telephones and now we have WhatsApp and video calls. So in future there, I'm imagining there will be new ways to communicate in the world of AI, potentially in the metaverse. We don't know what those ways will be, but what we do know is that communication will always be a fundamental human need to communicate, connect with others. so someone will have to create those experiences. Same with entertainment. Again, historically entertainment was in the past, like maybe

Piyush (19:10)
Right. Right, right.

Nikhil Maddirala (19:37)
people just told stories to each other and then there were like plays and then now and then there was art and now we have movies and so again in the AI world we don't know what entertainment will look like but we do know that there will be some need for entertainment experiences. So I think what I'm saying is that

We can definitely tell that new experiences are going to open up that fulfill some fundamental human needs. And I think the remaining question is just that, will there be a role for humans in creating and facilitating those experiences? Or you're positing that possibly AI, some version of AI that's artificial general intelligence, will be so capable that it can create these experiences without any human intervention, right?

Piyush (20:11)
Mm -hmm. Right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think it's just hard. Like this is beyond you and I to conclude today, but I love the framework that you're using to think about this, which is let's think about enduring human needs. And obviously let's keep a track on how things are evolving, which is why we're doing this podcast, right? Like we love talking about this stuff, following this stuff. however, just as an interesting thought experiment, let's say that it is

Nikhil Maddirala (20:29)
Yeah

Mm -hmm.

Piyush (20:56)
right, for the sake of argument that this time it is different and there is literally no job that cannot be done by AI in the future and you don't need humans to perform any job. What would that world look like? Do you have any ways to think about that world? And I know I've heard of things in the past, UBI being talked about in this world, but like, do you have a way of envisioning what this world might be or do you know any people who are thinking about these things?

Nikhil Maddirala (20:57)
Mm -hmm

It's hard I think to imagine this I mean of course purely speculatively you can so there's a lot of speculative work out there and I think there's some good books I read one is called life 3 .0 by Max Tegmark where he thinks about this There's another one by an economist. I think it's

Either Brian Kaplan or Richard Hansen, one of them, talk about a future in which we have these AGI's. So yeah, we can go into that, but I think the only challenge is that like, we just have no idea. Right now, if you say something like a world in which an AI can do all of this without humans, like I have no way of really conceptualizing that unless, except by looking at science fiction, because the trends I see today are actually more similar to the computer examples where

Piyush (22:06)
Mm -mm.

Nikhil Maddirala (22:14)
we're seeing new professions emerge like AI engineer, for example, or like AI content creators. And it's the same trends as before where it's about people.

learning to use these tools to enhance the way in which they perform their existing role. So it's like, and that's why we're doing this podcast, right? Trying to explain to people like, Hey, the things you're doing in your life, your business, society, can you enhance them using AI? And so, you know, there are new skills you have to learn with prompt engineering. We've done episodes on that in the past. You have to learn how to prompt AI and people who develop that skill better will be more productive.

and people who don't learning AI automations, APIs, things like that. So yeah, current trends that I'm seeing are pointing more in that direction. But sure, the one unknown thing is like how, what the world will be like if we have truly.

AGI like that's something the superhuman I mean the definition of this also is Unclear and not agreed upon by experts, but say it's just like a superhuman level. Yeah Like a godlike AI

Piyush (23:22)
like a god -like, a god -like AI basically. But that's why I actually love talking to you about this stuff because you're so grounded in reality and exactly, I think that's evident in just what you said in the last two minutes is like, okay, all of this fear mongering is based on a speculation that there will be this god -like entity called AGI, which will lead to singularity or whatever, right? But that's not the evidence that you're seeing now. The evidence that you're seeing now points to...

Nikhil Maddirala (23:42)
Yeah.

Piyush (23:49)
just what has happened in the past. Like we are seeing new types of jobs like prompt engineers. Like who would have thought about this thing called prompt engineering? forget 50 years back, just three or four years back even, right? So I think that's a good point is if you look at the evidence, it's pointing to us just leading down the same path as before. Yes, there is a revolution happening, which is why we're both interested in doing this podcast, but it seems like this is in line with the previous revolution. So I think we need to think about

Nikhil Maddirala (24:10)
Eh, eh.

And I also just want to say that these revolutions, even if they're in line with previous revolutions, they do cause a lot of upheaval. So when the Industrial Revolution happened, like a lot of people were out of work and they had nothing to do. And that led to unemployment. But these were short term effects. So they were limited to like one generation or maybe two generations at most. But in the long term, it rebalanced. And that rebalancing is a tough process because the people

Piyush (24:25)
Mm -hmm.

Nikhil Maddirala (24:47)
don't have the skills need to go re -skill themselves in the new way the world works. And this happening right now in America, if you look at the country is divided right? There's so much political unrest like a lot of that is due to this exact thing that people grew up believing in the idea of the American dream which was that hey if you can just go do an honest day's work from nine to five and do that consistently you can afford to have a family, have a house, have a car

all that stuff and now like because of the rate of change that's no longer true and if you grew up in a world where you just weren't exposed to computers and software let alone AI you're kind of lost in the world today and it's really hard to for you to create value and like extract value for for yourself so yeah I do think there are these significant impacts and just because they're isolated to you know a period

time for one or two generations it doesn't mean it doesn't suck like for all of those people it's really hard yeah

Piyush (25:50)
Yeah, yeah, no. I think one of the reasons why I worry about this so much is not just from a personal point of view, which is what I started with, right? Like, what do I do? What my wife does? What my children do? But actually at the back of my mind, it does worry me because of exactly what you mentioned, because of its potential to lead to societal upheaval. Right. Like, and I think you rightly pointed out, like, I mean, it's not just true in America, but in a lot of Western countries where

the American dream doesn't exist anymore or it's very hard for most people to achieve that because of all the changes that have happened. Yeah.

Nikhil Maddirala (26:28)
And actually we can tie back to your original question about UBI and things like that. So universal basic income. So whether that's something we need to deal with just temporarily for a couple of generations or whether it's a long term trend. I think this is something we as a society need to figure out is how to support like people who are no longer able to add value to the modern economy. And I think one of

proposals that's been gaining a lot of traction is some kind of universal basic income where we've reached a stage in the economy and society where we're producing enough to ensure everyone's well -being, but it's just kind of a problem of distribution that we're not able to distribute resources to people. it's because of the, like, I mean, we live in a capitalist world, right? And in capitalism,

you only earn as much as you contribute to society, or at least in theory. And of course there's ways in which like that's not realized in practice. But yeah, fundamentally it's worth thinking about whether that as a system like makes sense to continue into future or not. Because yeah, as you're saying, suppose technology can add more and more value.

then just because you as a human being are not able to add economic value through your work, your labor, whether that's physical, intellectual, whatever, does that mean that you don't have a right to enjoy some basic benefits and luxuries of life? And I think that's a really hard question. I think ideally we would find some model of society and economy where we can harvest

benefits of these technological advances and kind of distribute them to the world at large. But of course, like I have no idea, like you have to ask, where's this money going to come from? Are you going to like incredibly tax all these AI companies?

Piyush (28:32)
Yeah, I love that thought. I love where you're going though. It's just what you're saying is so big and profound. You're saying that we currently, the world that we live in is a capitalist world. Almost the entire world lives in a capitalist world, pretty much even China, right? And does this new AI revolution warrant a new type of system? And what does that system even look like? I think it's beyond you and I, but I would love to like, I think we can do a series on these topics, right? Like if

Nikhil Maddirala (28:43)
Mm -hmm.

Mm -hmm.

Yeah

Piyush (29:02)
this world where it doesn't even have to be AGI, like just the current world where we're heading, based the trajectory that we can predict based on the evidence that we're seeing, already needs that, means that a lot of changes are happening that warrants rethinking or reimagining the way we set up our society. Yeah, like re -examining, that would be the first step. And what would that look like? So I feel like we could do a mini series of episodes talking about one aspect of it, just the fact.

Nikhil Maddirala (29:18)
Yeah, or at least re -examining, even if you don't change.

Yeah?

Piyush (29:29)
Like we mentioned, UBI, I feel like we can do a deep dive on that in one of the episodes because there's this philosophical saying that man does not live by bread alone. So do you think UBI, just handing people out a basic income will not lead to upheaval? Like people also find meaning from their work, right? People don't like being handed out money, right? They want to know that what they're doing contributes meaningfully to the society and their lives. So I feel like there's so much to unpack, but this is like a great first discussion.

Nikhil Maddirala (29:33)
for sure.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Piyush (29:59)
on that mini -series potentially where we can talk about all of these things. Yeah.

Nikhil Maddirala (30:03)
Can I just add one last point on this? think what you said is really one of

fundamental issues which is the question of meaning. Like human beings are creatures that are driven by meaning also. I mean of course once you have your basic necessities taken care of if you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs once you have the basics taken care of then the next thing you need is a sense of meaning and I think it's one of the failures of capitalist society that most people tie their sense of meaning to their economic output and like you know most people if

ask them, what do you do? What's your life about? They give you a story about how they add economic value in the world. know, in this podcast, I say I'm an AI product manager, but I'm so much more than that. I'm a husband to my wife. I am, you know, a son to my parents. I'm a friend to people. have interests outside that. love, you know, like weightlifting, reading science fiction. And so why is it that we in this society only assign

Piyush (30:44)
Yeah.

Yeah.

Nikhil Maddirala (31:08)
significant meaning to activity that generates economic value or economic output and maybe that's something we would have to re -examine and I hope we do because I think for me that's one of the limitations of our current society.

Piyush (31:25)
Yeah, that's very well said. Yeah. I think I like the idea of the framing of re -examining. What we should do is we should pick apart all of these aspects like jobs, meaning, society, economic structures like capitalism. I don't know. Maybe there's like, that could be communism 2 .0 with AI. Who knows, right? Like we should pick them apart and re -examine them and re -evaluate them. But I liked our digression into this type of conversation today.

Nikhil Maddirala (31:32)
Ahem.

Yeah.

Piyush (31:54)
where we didn't talk a lot about the science of AI, but you just you keep saying in your opening a lot of times, you know, we're also trying to figure out how we can reimagine our lives or better lives at AI. And this is like one of those topics. So I think we should do this again, this type of topic. I would love to talk more about stuff like

Nikhil Maddirala (31:57)
