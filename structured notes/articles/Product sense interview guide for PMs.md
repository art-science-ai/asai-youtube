## Purpose of Product Sense interviews
The Product Sense interview focuses on evaluating how you take an ambiguous idea and create a great product. In addition to setting the vision for their teams and describing the most important problems to solve, Product Managers often will roll up their sleeves and work with their teams to identify and articulate ways to improve our products for the people who use them. This interview is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your product knowledge, creativity, and problem solving skills. Here are the **4 key skills** you will be evaluated on in the Product Sense interview:

1. **Structure**: PMs should be able to bring structure to open ended questions and answer them methodically. 
2. **Creativity and innovation**: PMs should be able to consistently generate creative and unique ideas for any given problem. 
3. **Prioritization and evaluation of tradeoffs**: PMs should be able to lay out various options and then evaluate the pros and cons of each option to prioritize the right choice.
4. **User empathy and ability to think about different user segments**: PMs should be able to identify and empathize with a broad range of user segments. You will need to identify various user segments and then put yourself in the shoes of a user to deeply understand their needs and challenges.

## How to structure your interview answer
The Product Sense interview usually starts with your interviewer describing a hypothetical product scenario for you to walk through. Regardless of the specific scenario, you can structure your answer by walking through these **4 key questions**:

1. **WHY are we building this product?** Understanding the product landscape and motivation
2. **WHO are we building this for?** Determining the target audience
3. **WHAT problem are we solving?** Identifying and prioritizing the problem
4. **HOW are we solving the problem?** Developing creative and impactful solutions while making intentional design choices

## The accordion framework for Product Sense interviews
The accordion framework consists of two steps: 
1. Brainstorming to generate ideas (like opening an accordion)
2. Prioritizing to narrow down on one idea (like closing an accordion)

Brainstorming tips:
- Breadth-first-search: go as broad as possible
- Group your options into logical buckets 
- Aim for 3+ buckets with 3+ options per bucket

Prioritization tips:
- Use a simple prioritization framework
- Prioritize buckets first then prioritize options 
- Connect back to earlier stages

The simplest way to demonstrate your Product Sense skills (structure, creativity, prioritization, and user empathy) is to apply the accordion framework across **4 key stages** of the Product Sense interview:
