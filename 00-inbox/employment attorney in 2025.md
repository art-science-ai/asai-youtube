Hi, my name is Nikhil in San Mateo CA. I’m seeking an immediate consultation with an employment attorney (ideally within 24 hrs) to discuss a potential employment contract violation with my employer. Could you please let me know your earliest availability? You can reach me at nikhil.maddirala@gmail.com or 203-214-9055.

I need to find an employment attorney who I can have a consultation with at the earliest - ideally within the next 12-24 hours. I live in San Mateo CA. Prefer phone / video call consult. Please help me thoroughly research two things:

(1) Individual employment attorneys I can contact

(2) Online platforms I can use to consult with attorneys on short notice

Also give me a process I can use to quickly find someone based on this research.
```
