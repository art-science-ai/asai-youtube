### Context
On October 7 2025 I was contacted by Meta's internal employment investigation team notifying me that I may be in violation of Meta's policies on outside activities, external engagements, and/or conflicts of interest with respect to the following activities:

- Mentorship @ Mentorcruise and Topmate
- Podcasting @ Art and Science of AI 
- Open source AI @ AI Alliance

This note describes the details of my activities, the red flags raised by the investigation, and my rationale for my actions.

### Addttl mentorship info
- By the time I became a trained PM interviewer I ceased all mentorship related to mentorship for job search, interview prep, or career growth and included a prominent disclaimer on my profile stating that I am not offering these services (this disclaimer is still visible on my profile today).  
-  

### Summary
- My activities
	- Mentorship (Feb 2024–May 2025): ~25 hours total (~25 min/week) via Mentorcruise + Topmate; ~$3,500 gross (<1% annual income); ceased before investigation.
	- Podcasting (May 2023–Dec 2024): Guest on Docents and Intentional Product Manager; co-hosted Art and Science of AI (~15 episodes); no monetization; content focused on publicly available AI/PM topics.
	- AI Alliance (since Sep 2024): Contributor to Open Agent Lab within a Meta-supported, multi-company open-source initiative; no compensation.
- Red flags raised by the investigation
	- Potential disclosure or leverage of Meta confidential / non-public information in mentorship / podcasts.
	- Lack of prior approval for outside activities; use of Meta affiliation in public profiles.
	- Two mentees later joined Meta (perceived conflict).
	- Clarification requested on process adherence and any compensation related to AI Alliance.
- My rationale
	- No confidential disclosure: I did not disclose or use any confidential or non-public Meta information in any outside activities; all topics stayed within public or industry-general knowledge
	- Affiliation & disclaimers: No materials represented my views as Meta’s; Meta affiliation was not included in any podcast titles or descriptions (with one exception that was outside my control); explicit disclaimer was included in some places, though not everywhere
	- No hiring conflicts: I had no involvement in interview loops or hiring decisions for mentees who later joined Meta.
	- No performance impact: No interference with job duties; performance ratings always exceeded expectations, including promotion during the relevant period.
	- Limited scale / scope: Based on the limited scale / scope of mentorship and podcasting activities, I believed approval was not required; I acknowledge the need for stricter interpretation and will follow pre-approval processes going forward.
	- Meta-supported work: AI Alliance participation followed internal processes for that initiative; no personal compensation was received.
- Remediation
	- Mentorship: Activity already ceased prior to investigation; additionally I will take down all profiles and take any more necessary remediation steps
	- Podcasting: Where a disclaimer was omitted (e.g., Art and Science of AI), I will add one retroactively.
	- AI Alliance: Continue to ensure compliance with Meta processes.

### Appendix: Mentorship
- Timeline
	- Mentorcruise mentee sessions: early 2023 - late 2023
	- Mentorcruise mentor sessions: February 2024 - May 2024
	- Role change to agentic AI at Meta: June 2025
	- Closed mentorship: September 2025
	- Meta's internal employment investigation: October 2025
- Activity & compensation
	- ~50 total sessions @ 30 min each = ~25 hours total over ~16 months = ~25 mins / week time spent
	- ~5 recurring mentees + one-off / intro calls
	- ~$3,500 gross compensation (<1% of my annual Meta compensation)
- Details of activity
	- I joined Mentorcruise as a mentee in early 2023 for mentorship on product leadership and career growth. After being a mentee for nearly a year and getting a lot of value out of the experience, I then decided to try being a mentor.
	- My first mentorship session as a mentor was in Feb 2024, and my last session was in June 2025.  
	- I made my account inactive in September 2025, prior to any outreach from Meta's internal employment investigation team.
	- These were a mix of intro calls (mostly unpaid) and recurring mentorships (~ 5 mentees). I received a grand total of ~$3,500 in compensation over the entire period.
- Nature of the sessions
	- Introductory calls: these are just intro calls where we get to know each other to determine if mentorship is a good fit. I provide some high level guidance on what the mentee should focus on. Most of them are unpaid, but some were ~$25 / call.
	- Ongoing mentorship: help with long term goals like learning to build your first AI agent or making a career transition. Around $50-100 / session with 2-4 sessions per month.
- Why I engaged in these activities
	- Gaining mentorship skills: As an aspiring product leader, mentoring other product managers is an important skill for me to develop, and I thought this would be a good learning opportunity. 
	- Passion for learning education: I love learning. I have 3 masters degrees, and I'm constantly learning new things from books, online courses, newsletters, etc. I love sharing my learnings to educate others - both at Meta and outside Meta. 
		- Outside Meta Podcast; shared my learnings about AI; also shared internally and my former manager publicly thanked me for it
		- Inside Meta: I'm always sharing learnings in WP groups, chats, meetings. My current leadership (incl. my VP) recognized me for this and encouraged me educate broader audiences at Meta on agentic AI.
- Why I believe I was not doing anything wrong 
	- I did not disclose any confidential or non-public information to anyone outside Meta in the course of my activities.
		- PM mentorship: I coached people on general PM skills using publicly available knowledge. Original branded myself as PM + AI mentor. In early 2024 I completely stopped PM mentorship and focused exclusively on AI mentorship.
		- AI mentorship: I coached people on agentic AI skills based on publicly available knowledge. I did not have access to non-public information about agentic AI, because my job (until June 2025) was focused on machine learning, which is very different. In June 2025 I switched to a new role at Meta focusing on agentic AI, after which I did not engage in any such mentorship.
	- I was not motivated by financial gain; my income from mentorship was less than 1% of my annual income from Meta. I was motivated by wanting to gain mentorship skills and a passion for sharing my knowledge.
	- I never attempted to hide my outside activities from anybody. My mentorship was on a public website. I also podcasted publicly and shared this with my whole team
	- It did not interfere with my ability to perform my job well. I exceeded expectations in every performance cycle and I even got promoted during this period.
- Data sources
	- Primary: Stripe account shows total payout of ~$3,500 with ~36 total transactions (- 4 reversals + ~15 batched = ~50)
	- Secondary
		- Mentorcruise dashboard shows activity only for my 2nd year of mentorship from July 29 2024 - July 13 2025. This shows ~35 bookings, but many of these were unpaid, and some of them never occurred due to cancelation or no-show. My estimate is that I had ~25 sessions of 30 mins each in this period.
		- There is no data for my 1st year, but I estimate that my activity was similar in both years, so the estimated grand total is <50 sessions, i.e. 25 hours.
		- Mentorcruise public profile: ~15 months of mentorships + 5 sessions
