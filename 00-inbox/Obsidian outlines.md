- Two approaches to outlining in Obsidian
	- Bullets
		- Pro: Easy to nest / unnest and change levels using the Obsidian outliner plugin.
		- Con: Cannot have complex text formatting like code blocks, tables, etc. inside bullets
	- Headers: 
		- Pro: Can have complex text formatting
		- Con: Restructuring the outline is more difficult. If I want to nest / unnest a header I need to change all the header levels in the doc appropriately.
- Ideally I want to be able to use headers like outlines with easy nesting / unnesting. 
	- Example scenario and pain point
		- I start with this outline
			- Parent topic 1 (H1)
				- Child topic a (H2)
				- Child topic b (H2)
			- Parent topic 2 (H1)
				- Child topic x (H2)
				- Child topic y (H2)
		- Then I realize that I also want to include different Grandparent topics as H1s. If I'm using outlines, it's as easy as selecting all the existing bullets and pressing tab. But with headers, I have to manually change each and every header every time I make this change.
	- Requirements
		- Easily shift different heading levels with a hotkey similar to bullets
	- Plugins I've found so far - 
		- https://github.com/Netajam/header-adjuster
		- https://github.com/Lord-Turmoil/heading-toggler-obsidian
		- https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter
	- Solution: using heading shifter for now, it works!
	- Need to assign hotkeys for fold/unfold and shift.
