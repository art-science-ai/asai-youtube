## Dusk Vault - Personal Knowledge Management System

Welcome to the Dusk Vault! This is a comprehensive Obsidian vault that combines two powerful note-taking methodologies to help you manage both your active work and long-term knowledge.

## What is This Vault For?

This vault is designed to help you:
- **Manage projects and tasks** with clear deadlines and goals
- **Organize areas of responsibility** that are ongoing (health, finances, hobbies, etc.)
- **Build a personal knowledge base** of ideas, insights, and learnings
- **Capture and develop thoughts** from fleeting ideas to permanent knowledge

## The Two Systems

### 📁 PARA System - For Action & Work

Use PARA for anything that requires action, has a deadline, or relates to your work and responsibilities:

**PROJECTS** - Things with a deadline
- Example: "Launch new website by March"
- Example: "Plan summer vacation"
- These are temporary - you complete them and they're done

**AREAS** - Ongoing responsibilities
- Example: "Health & Fitness" (always ongoing, no end date)
- Example: "Home Maintenance"
- Example: "Professional Development"
- These are permanent areas of your life you maintain

**RESOURCES** - Reference materials for PARA work
- **CONTACTS**: People you work with
- **DOCUMENTATIONS**: How-to guides for your projects
- **CONCEPT MAP**: Visual diagrams and canvases
- **MEETINGS**: Meeting notes (general, standup, team)

**ARCHIVES** - Completed or inactive projects/areas
- Move finished projects here
- Keep them for reference but out of your active workspace

**WORKSTATION** - Quick notes for PARA work
- Scratch pad for project ideas
- Temporary notes that haven't found their home yet
- Think of it as your desk drawer for PARA stuff

### 🧠 ZETA (Zettelkasten) - For Knowledge & Ideas

Use ZETA for building your personal knowledge base - concepts, ideas, and insights NOT directly tied to a specific project:

**PERMANENT** - Developed, atomic ideas
- One clear idea per note
- Written in your own words
- Example: "Resilience as an Adaptive Response"
- These are the building blocks of your thinking

**LITERATURE** - Notes from books, articles, papers
- Capture key ideas from sources
- Example: "Masten, A.S. (2001). Resilience Theory in Developmental Psychology"
- Include citations and sources

**FLEETING** - Quick captures of raw thoughts
- Ideas that pop into your head
- Things you don't want to forget
- Later, you'll process these into permanent notes

## The Golden Rule: Keep PARA and ZETA Separate

**PARA notes link to PARA notes. ZETA notes link to ZETA notes.**

Why? Because they serve different purposes:
- PARA is about *doing* - it's temporary and action-oriented
- ZETA is about *understanding* - it's permanent and knowledge-oriented

Mixing them creates confusion. When working on a project, link to other PARA notes. When developing an idea, link to other ZETA notes.

## Special Folders

### 📍 HUB - Your Navigation Center
- **Homepage**: Your starting point - see everything at a glance
- **Map of Content**: Browse and explore your notes by topic
- **Mail Box**: Track important notes you've flagged for attention

### 📅 DAILY - Time-Based Notes
- **DAILY**: Journal entries, daily planning
- **WEEKLY**: Week reviews and planning
- **MONTHLY**: Month reviews and bigger picture planning
- **QUARTERLY & YEARLY**: Long-term reflection (if you use them)

### 📌 STICKY - The Junk Drawer
Quick disposable notes that don't belong anywhere else. Delete these freely.

### ⚙️ SYSTEM - Don't Touch (Usually)
Templates, settings, and system files. You'll rarely need to look here unless you're customizing the vault.

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project
1. Create a Project Family (there's likely a template or command)
2. It creates a folder with your project name
3. Add project notes inside that folder
4. Link your project to related Areas using tags
5. Track tasks within the project
6. When done, move to ARCHIVES

### Managing an Area of Life
1. Create an Area Family (like "Health & Fitness")
2. Add notes related to that area
3. Create projects within this area when you have specific goals
4. Use tags to connect everything (e.g., `#area/health`)
5. Review regularly - areas are ongoing

### Building Knowledge (Zettelkasten)
1. Capture quick thoughts in FLEETING notes
2. When reading something valuable, create LITERATURE notes
3. Regularly review FLEETING and LITERATURE notes
4. Extract key insights into PERMANENT notes
5. Link PERMANENT notes to each other to build your knowledge network
6. Let insights emerge from the connections

### Daily Routine
1. Open the **Homepage** to see your dashboard
2. Check the **Mail Box** for flagged items
3. Create or open today's **DAILY** note
4. Review tasks and meetings for today
5. Work on active projects in **PROJECTS**
6. Capture thoughts in **FLEETING** notes
7. End of day: process fleeting notes if you have time

## Key Features

### Page Tasks
Mark any note as a "Page Task" to make it appear in your Mail Box. Use this for notes that need your attention.

### Project Dashboard
For complex projects, use the Project Dashboard to see all project notes in one place. You can filter by specific project folders.

### Tag-Based Organization
- Tag your notes with area tags like `#area/health` or `#area/work/strategy`
- Tasks and meetings tagged with these automatically appear in the relevant area notes
- This creates automatic connections without manual linking

### Dynamic Tables
Many notes have tables that automatically update based on tags and links. These help you see related notes without maintaining manual lists.

## Finding Things

- **Homepage**: Your main dashboard - see everything important
- **Map of Content**: Browse notes by topic
- **Search**: Use Obsidian's search (Ctrl+Shift+F by default)
- **Quick Switcher**: Jump to any note by name (Ctrl+O by default)
- **Graph View**: See connections between notes visually

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Open the **Homepage** and explore the interface
- [ ] Read the files in `SYSTEM/GETTING STARTED` for detailed walkthroughs
- [ ] Create your first Area (something you're already managing in life)
- [ ] Create a FLEETING note with a quick thought
- [ ] Try creating a DAILY note
- [ ] Browse the templates in `SYSTEM/TEMPLATE/FORMAT` to see examples
- [ ] Experiment with the Project Dashboard
- [ ] Don't worry about doing it perfectly - just start using it!

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Pick one area of your life to organize first
2. **Use the templates**: Don't create blank notes - use the templates provided
3. **Review regularly**: Set aside time weekly to process fleeting notes and review projects
4. **Trust the system**: It feels complex at first, but the structure helps as your vault grows
5. **Customize gradually**: Learn the system first, customize later
6. **Don't overthink note placement**: If you're unsure, put it in STICKY and sort it later

## When to Use What

| If you need to... | Use... |
|-------------------|--------|
| Track a work project with a deadline | PARA → PROJECTS |
| Manage an ongoing area of life | PARA → AREAS |
| Remember someone's contact info | PARA → RESOURCES → CONTACTS |
| Capture a quick thought | ZETA → FLEETING |
| Note down book insights | ZETA → LITERATURE |
| Develop a personal concept | ZETA → PERMANENT |
| Write today's journal | DAILY → DAILY |
| Create disposable scratch notes | STICKY |

## Philosophy

This vault is built on the idea that **different types of information need different types of organization**:

- **Projects** are temporary → they need clear outcomes and completion
- **Areas** are permanent → they need ongoing maintenance
- **Knowledge** is networked → it needs connections and development
- **Time-based** notes are sequential → they need chronological organization

By keeping these separate, you can focus on the right mindset for each type of work.
