- 1-1 [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Marvin Kim|Marvin Kim]]
	- SGAI4P -

			- Existing workstreams should continue as they are
			- Overall program level set-up 
		- upcoming summit, hoping to get clear strategies out of the summit for each priority area

	- Agenda
		- Review w/ Zhen Sha Marvin Fan - next week
	- Music programming / production
		- Wei makes music with music programming
		- Traditionally people make music with bands
		- Digital music production
	- Wei feedback on PM
		- Wei discussed w Yuhui and Fan that PM role in this org is very challenging and no explicit business product; problem formulation is very technical in this space
		- Feedback for me: lot of people have their initial thoughts but let go of them in the face of constraints and then they give up and stop pushing back; Wei likes that he gets challenged and I push back; SEAR problem formulation is difficult and I was able to help navigate
	- Other focus areas for Wei - may not need PM support
		- Model consolidation - cross consent consolidation - very political / ownership issues / Model space governance - lot of overlap w/ AI org
		- LeadQuality - part of AI4P - Wei is focusing on technical improvement collaborating w/ CAG and FAM
	- Yuhui had some negative feedback on SAIL -> SGAI4P renaming
	- DMF <> SEAR: 0.2% - 0.3% per year for ~9 HC
