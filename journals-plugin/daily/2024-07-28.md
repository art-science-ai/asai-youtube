	- Call Piyush
	- Call Rick 
	- Message Seth
		- Hi Seth, this is Nikhil Maddirala. Hope you're doing well! 😊 I'm considering making an offer on this home (see link) which is due by August 1st, and I'm looking for a real estate agent to help me with the process. Rick Wisher suggested reaching out to you. Do you have some time for a call today or tomorrow? Thank you! 
		- Hey Kirsten, this is Nikhil Maddirala. Seth asked me to reach out to you (see screenshot), and I was wondering if you have some time for a call today or tomorrow? Thank you!
		- I just spoke with Kirsten, thanks! We both have some homework to do and will sync again in the evening.
		- I'm currently undecided on whether I want this as a primary home or investment property, and she suggested that you might be better positioned to advise me on that question because of your experience managing rental properties.
