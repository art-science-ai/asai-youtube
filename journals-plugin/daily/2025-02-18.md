- 1-1 [[Parth Patel]]
	- Intro - self
		- PM on AI for Ads
		- AI / RAG power user
	- Intro - Parth
		- Indexed all docs - static pages, wikis, wp posts, docs, etc.
		- Their team doesn't want other people to build on top of this - primarily for Metamate
		- Stan + Hack commands are the main ways to expose this functionality 
		- Working on a project called "Metamate spaces" - like Claude Projects
		- Memory agent is built as a hack command -as a domain agent - built a tool for docs you have personally interacted with
	- RAG Dumont console
		- Metamate team built their own search index - docs, posts, etc.
		- Thrift service on top that lets you query this - additional steps like re-ranker etc.
		- Separately also intern_search index - these two are separate for now, but over time will figure out how to consolidate - org / political issues
		- IS folks trying to migrate more folks to IS instead of Metamate
	- Metamate personalization
		- Personalization is a big investment area for Metamate
		- Memory is one of the main projects right now, but still clarifying vision
		- Big investments: memory, retrieval, Metamate spaces
	- RAG questions - start with demo use case screen share
		- Intern search vs. Metamate retrieval indexes
		- API methods - Stan, Hack - what else?
		- How to get instant update of docs via API?
			- Fresh copy is via explicit retrieval - paste URL itself; paste a master doc with URLs and descriptions 
		- RAG console
	- PM / org questions
		- Overall org structure
			- Metamate
			- Data AI Labs - AI consultancy group in data infra; Parth is RAG TL; working in embedded way w/ Metamate and Meta AI - works across the stack - pre-training with LAMA, Semantic Search, etc. from the lens of data infra - is also honorary member of Metamate team; he works on personalization on Metamate side
			- Metamate PM: Michale Slater
			- Data: Soji Igbe
		- PM org structure
	- Extra qs
- Payam follow-up
	- Hey XX. I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to chat with me about the PM role. I heard from Payam that the team decided to move forward with another candidate, but I'd love to stay connected for future opportunities, and I'm also looking forward to using the new developer productivity tools your team is building! 😊

	- New privacy change: A&A policy change
		- OBA strict > getting folded into OBA pragmatic

- Qs from Marvin
	- Expands Link History and the use of 3PD for contextual features to EU/GDPR-like countries, which is a 0.22% iRev (FY28) opportunity.
	  
	  Not sure what the 0.22% iRev breakdown is, but there are two components:
	  
	  Link History
	  
	  We are getting new LH 1PD by treating LH opt-out users as opt-in users.
	  
	  3PD for contextual features 
	  
	  This is a new type of 3PD that IAB team is collecting called "contextual browsing data" which is like when they show you post-click recommendations in IAB and the user engages with those recommendations.
