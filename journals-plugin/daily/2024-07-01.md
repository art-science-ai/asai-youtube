		- I'm restarting my journaling and habits today after a long time, yay! Always feels good to start again after some time off. Let me go until 8:15 - 8:20 with this. 
		- I exercised for the first time in a couple of weeks. That felt good. But I'm also super winded and not super strong. That's okay - I got back into it! I love that I did that. Do certainly need to improve cardio fitness and strength, but I made a great start! Feeling good about my habits too. Started off the week with a bang.
		- Reflecting on this weekend. I spent a ton of time with unstructured exploration of Obsidian. Well, what's wrong with that? The only answer I can come up with is that it wasn't productive. That's okay. It was the weekend! Yes, but wouldn't it be better to use the weekend more intentionally? Either for rest and relaxation or to make progress on some tasks? This sounds like the manager voice again. I think it's fine to have times when I'm just doing things totally unstructured and not worry about it!

		- Today was a great day! Started off with high motivation from the fresh start and was very productive and did all my habits! Got some high pri tasks done too.
	- Reflect: What didn't go well today?
		- Morning was intentional and focused, then I think the evening was unfocused and I spent a lot of time in ways I didn't want. Spent time on random Outlook sync app for a long time, didn't prioritize ways to connect with Rukma.

	- Create [[Butterfly at Meta]] rule to categorize focus blocks
		- Any work-arounds for non-meta email addresses? 
		  
		  I'm trying to create a Butterfly rule to categorize personal / family meetings on my calendar, but Butterfly doesn't seem to support non-Meta email addresses. Any workarounds I can try? Thanks in advance! 😊
		  
		  The rule I want to create is
		  WHEN a meeting is created on my calendar
		  AND the meeting's attendees include my_wife's_email_address
		  THEN set that meeting's category to my_family_category_name

- Chat w Recruiting team on [[Reverse shadow bottleneck]] [[Diana Watanabe]] [[Yoav Arnstein]] [[John McCarthy]] [[Elijah Padua]] [[Kathryn Braatz]]
	- Context and current status of RS
		- Backlog: 569 interviewers
		- 3% of interviews have reverse shadow looplines
		- 296 calibrated RS interviewers; 78% of calibrated RS interviewers are online
	- Roadblocks
		- RS needs extended interview with additional availability; difficult to schedule
		- Lot of rescheduling: 68.6% interviews need rescheduling; 21% candidate drive, 74% interviewer driven
	- Is this even a problem worth solving?
		- Number of interviewers is not a constraint for interview process
		- But PMs want to get trained
	- Problems - two problems
		- RS not included in the loopline to begin with 
		- RS already included in loopline but got rescheduled (could be solved by marketplace)
	- Solutions
		- Solution: get into Interview Marketplace - 
			- Challenge: Difficult because you need to add another interview to candidate loop
			- Solution: can we have it only for reschedules and cancelations?
		- Solution: proactively schedule reverse shadows and then try to fill the slot
			- Candidates probably would love to hear that 4 interviews and now only 3
		- Other ways to train PM interviewers without having to take up candidate time?
			- E.g. mock interviews or simulated interviews with new hire PMs (this creates a fake experience - not realistic)
		- Solution: Use Meta-side cancelation as opportunity for filling RS
- [[Advertiser Inbound AI]] w [[Sagar Pilania]] [[Varun Aggarwal]]
	- Sagar following up w Shyam and Deepak to assign Eng
	- Varun following up w Kristen to assign PMM
	- Alternatively - other ads eng teams

		- Sales software - CRM etc.
- 1-1 w [[Prateek Bhansali]]
	- LH labels
		- GenAI - can we use LH urls to get labels; given a url sequence, can we predict whether a conversion happened or not
		- Web crawl content in RAG; ask "what did the user do, what are the user's interests"
- 1-1 w [[Rohit Kumar - Topmate]] from [[Topmate.io]] [[Linkedin growth coach]]
	- Feedback
		- I'm spread very thin - too many platforms from the beginning
		- Focus only on one platform them move to other one
		- E.g. start with linkedin
	- Rohit's services
		- Marketing agency that offers management services
		- Competitor analysis
		- Storytelling call - once a month
		- Create posts - and manage the accounts
	- Also has consulting services
		- Book consulting calls on Linkedin
	- Personal profile vs. brand profile
		- Personal profile has a face to relate to - more likely to take off
		- Company page growth likely to be slower
		- Can use personal profile to post more for a period of time and drive people back to the brand page
