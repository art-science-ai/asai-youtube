## Today's notes
- [[ai4e onboarding]]
- Feedback on journals plugin
	- Scenario: I have multiple Obsidian windows open with multiple tabs in each window.
	- Action: I use the command "Journals: open today's note" OR I click on today's date in the calendar-timeline block
	- Expected result: It should open today's note in my current window
	- Actual result: It takes me to a different window where today's note is open
