## Today's notes
- [[llama stack demo project]] - local AI proposal
	- kTLDR: local AI and the opportunity for Meta to drive LLM developer adoption
		- Open-source “local AI” (a trending re-brand of "on-prem") tools enabling AI to run without cloud services have rapidly gained traction. Developers face data privacy concerns, high cloud costs, and the desire for offline access, all of which local AI can address.
		- There is a huge community of developers interested in the "local AI" movement , with a 1M+ developer audience that is exponentially growing.
		- When developers search for "local ai" on Github / Youtube / Reddit / Google / etc. their top results are ollama, open-webui, docker, etc. 
		- Meta and llama-stack are almost NEVER featured in these communities and associated content — this is a timely opportunity for Meta to take charge and be at the forefront of this trend with llama-stack!
		- Note from Nikhil: As an active participant and builder in many of these communities, I believe llama-stack is highly synergistic with the goals of this community, and would love to help if there is interest! The default local ai stack of ollama + open-web-ui only supports inference. Adding llama-stack opens up support for agents and more!
	- Audience characteristics
		- Privacy conscious - they worry about sending sensitive data to cloud APIs
		- Cost conscious – want to avoid API fees and subscriptions
		- Offline availability - developers like the idea of using an AI assistant on an airplane or in remote areas with no internet
	- Audience segments
		- Professional developers
		- "Indy devs" and solopreneurs building web / mobile apps and services
		- Vibe coders building personal projects (an exponentially growing audience)
		- Open source developers building open source AI tools and frameworks
		- ML researchers or engineers who fine-tune models and experiment with new architectures
	- Communities and influencers 
		- Reddit
			- [r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA) - Reddit ~485k members with [~2x yearly growth](https://gummysearch.com/r/LocalLLaMA/#:~:text=Member%20Growth%20in%20r%2FLocalLLaMA)

		- Youtubers
			- [@ColeMedin](https://www.youtube.com/@ColeMedin) - Youtube - 133k+ - has private community - focus on local AI
			- Many other Youtubers have one or two videos on local AI, but their primary focus is something else like AI, coding, etc.: 
		- Youtube videos
			- [Run ALL Your AI Locally in Minutes (LLMs, RAG, and more)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_0dNE-H2gw) - 500k+ views 
			- [host ALL your AI locally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjrdr0NU4Sk) - 1.9M+ views
			- [Set up a Local AI like ChatGPT on your own machine!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYhC7nFRL5I) - 1M+ views

			- Other active servers include those for Ollama, LM Studio, and LocalAI, each likely in the few thousands to tens of thousands of members
			- May youtubers have their own private communities on Discord / Skool / etc.
	- Top tools and frameworks discussed in the local ai communities (note: these are some of the fastest growing open source projects of all time)
		- Primary
			- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) - 140k+ stars - CLI tool & server for running LLMs easily (one-click model install, OpenAI-compatible API).
			- open-webui - 98k+ stars - Full-stack web platform for local AI: multi-user chat UI with support for plugins, voice, RAG, etc.; originally started as ollama-webui
			- llama.cpp - 70k+ stars - C/C++ library for efficient LLM inference on CPU/GPU; core back-end for ollama
			- LocalAI - 33k+ stars - Self-hosted OpenAI-like API server for local models (REST API compatibility).
			- GPT4All
			- [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) - 153k+ stars - Web UI for image generation models
		- Complementary (used in conjunction with primary tools)
			- n8n - 100k+ stars
			- docker
			- mcp servers
		- Nikhil's collection of interesting open source AI projects
	- Recommendations
		- Partner with open source influencers
			- Sponsored YouTube video including an open source github repo featuring llama-stack (@ColeMedin would be a good fit)
