	- Background
		- Created design framework for AI; lot of AI bots being built with no creative principles and framework; bots not getting user adoption and engagement
		- Started presenting this all the way up the chain; need to present to Chief AI officer in January
		- This is coming to a close now - people are aligned
	- Current goals
		- Create a unified conversational experience with preserved context
		- Different bots - HR bot, sales bot, etc. - need to preserve context
		- Example: User goes to chatbot in Teams interface > Chatnow bot
	- Problems
		- One continuous chat conversation - no way to start new conversation
		- Lacking knowledge
		- Not conversational interface - buttons that you press
	- Strategy
		- Company overall has some high level understanding of end state
		- The team now wants to do one project that's design-led, starting in Jan; conversation driven development
		- Yves role is to have an iteration once a month
		- Start with onboarding experience for new employees
