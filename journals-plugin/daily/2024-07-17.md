	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- Today I woke up a bit too early. It was okay. Messed around on my phone a little bit, then started my morning routine. Did a good exercise. Why am I waking up too early? It certainly has something to do with the increased vyvanse dose. I notice I sleep well with zero vyvanse, sleep okay with 30mg, and sleep worse with 60mg. But I'm taking 60mg because it's helping a lot with productivity and motivation. Need to find a way to wean off the vyvanse. Maybe try qelbree for a bit? That was one option that I had explored earlier but not tried. I can give it a shot for a couple of months and go back to vyvanse if I don't like it. Also need to take longer vyvanse breaks. Defs need one day a week on zero dose. Sunday is good for that. Expand that to more also would be good. Take few days with lower dose as well. Use the high dose selectively. 
		- What else on my mind? Did a good z2 workout today. I'm happy that I'm doing more of that now. I could even up my exercise to 2x per day if I feel it. It could be cardio in the mornings and strength in the afternoons / evenings. Maybe at some point I can step up to that. What's a good way of starting that small? Maybe like just on the days I do the cardio in the morning, see what it feels like to do strength in the evenings. But don't over exert at this stage. Progress gradually and build solid habits. I'll have much better returns consistently building up daily exercise vs. trying to over do it right now.
		- Yesterday was pretty good. Made progress on work stuff as well as the rag project. Feel good about it. How's connections going? Time to think of someone to reach out to today. Why not Isola? Let's start there!
