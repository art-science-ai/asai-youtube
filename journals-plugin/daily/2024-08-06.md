	- Tell us about yourself  
		- Hi, I'm Nikhil! I'm an AI Product Manager at Meta (and formerly Adobe), where I've built and scaled multiple AI products serving billions of individuals and millions of businesses. I'm also a part-time AI educator and mentor - I run a podcast called "Art and Science of AI". 
		- Prior to AI Product Management, I advised Fortune 500 companies on AI strategy and implementation as a Consultant at Deloitte. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife Rukma, and my hobbies include reading science fiction & fantasy and weightlifting! 🏋️
	- What first piqued your interest in a transition in to AI product management?  
		- I've been involved with AI for over 10 years now. I wrote my first master's thesis back in 2014 on comparing two different approaches to language understanding: formal semantics (rule based systems) vs. natural language processing (machine learning) 
		- I then went to grad school at Yale to study business, but focused my elective coursework on Computer Science and Machine Learning. Just when I was learning Natural Language Processing and Language Modeling, OpenAI launched GPT-2, and I was blown away by its possibilities and implications for AI's transformative impact on business and society. 
	- How did you land your first opportunity?  
		- What?
			- PM on Adobe Experience Platform
		- How
			- MBA recruiting programs at companies
			- My passion for ML
	- What helped you differentiate yourself from other candidates [if applicable]  
	- What technical and other skills did you pick up before and during your transition?  
		- I decided to pivot my career to focus on AI, and I joined Adobe as an AI Product Manager. While building AI capabilities for Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Acrobat, I spent my evenings and weekends learning Computer Science and Machine Learning; along the way I built some cool AI side projects and a masters degree in CS from UPenn. Soon I was sought after by several big tech companies for my expertise in AI and Product Management, and I was recruited by Meta to work on AI for Ads.
	- What advice would you have for other product managers transitioning into AI product management?
		- Use AI in your role
		- Think of it as a multi-step journey. In each step, minimize the degrees of transition
			- Function
			- Industry
			- Technical domain
			- Type of product
		- For each transition, showcase some work product
