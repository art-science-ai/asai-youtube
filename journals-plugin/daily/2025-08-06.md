	- Intro
		- 5 yrs at Meta; whole time in QE; works across multiple areas of QE
		- Sev prevention, canary, regression analysis, metric monitor in Deltoid
		- Focus on safety
	- Use case
		- Problem: which experiment caused SEV?  
			- Sev report doesn't show root cause.
			- Mobile Config (MC) - parameter fetching system - linked to QE; it's a way of bypassing app update requirements
		- Current solution
			- Sev report has sev triggering field - someone manually enters experiments
			- It's a multiple choice question. Can be caused by code change + config change + experiment allocation change
			- People might just choose code change and ignore the experiment field
		- How can experiment cause sev?
			- E.g. if experiment chooses wrong settings. universe default=false will often cause sevs
			- Changing experiment parameters. 
		- Hao's AI solution
			- Take the inputs from sev report
			- Use Metamate to infer which experiments may be causing the SEV
		- Goals and metrics
			- Experiment quality
