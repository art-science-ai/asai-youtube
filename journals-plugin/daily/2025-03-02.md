## Today's notes
- Sync music production macbook iPad
	- How to sync music production projects between macbook and ipad with the following setup:
		- On my macbook I have logic pro and garageband
		- On my iPad I have only garageband, not logic pro (I can buy logic pro for iPad if needed)
		- I have iCloud drive on my iPad, but not on my Macbook. This is a hard constraint, I can't get iCloud drive on my Macbook.
		- I can use wired USB connection between iPad and Macbook for file transfer.
		- I usually initiate my projects on iPad in Garageband and then transfer to Mac for further editing.
	- Explain the sync for various scenarios:
		- Garageband on macboook + garageband on iPad
		- Logic Pro on macbook + garageband on iPad
		- Logic Pro on macbook + Logic pro on iPad
