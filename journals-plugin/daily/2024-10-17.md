Shop Ads SA-OFF/3PD - Pre-click Plans
Hi all, starting a thread to sync on follow-ups from the Shop Ads SA-OFF/3PD design review. I believe the main action item is to start a deep dive doc for discussion at the upcoming NYC offsite [A].

German suggested starting a thread with this group to get the ball rolling. Shu and I would love to collaborate from CoreML side. 

Xiuhui Ye / Daniel Pecynski — do we have any existing doc already?
