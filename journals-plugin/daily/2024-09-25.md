##### Snippets
Any updates on Referral Bonus Transparency?

The referral bonus policy states that employees are ineligible for a referral bonus for "submissions that are made after the candidate has already engaged in the recruiting process" (https://www.internalfb.com/people/portal/career/employee-referrals/referral-bonuses)

Several employees have been complaining on this group that this process is not transparent to them, and they often invest a lot of time and energy into referrals only to find out in the end that they were not eligible for a referral bonus
