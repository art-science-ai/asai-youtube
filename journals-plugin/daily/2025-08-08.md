## Today's notes
- Learning QE w/ [[Ming Chang]] and intern
	- Change text in Launch Tracking dashboard title
	- First make a diff for the code change
	- QE setup
		- Choose universe
		- Configure parameters
			- Define parameters
			- Define values for control / test
		- Change code 
- 1-1 [[Omri Ziv]]
	- Intro 
		- Company for 8 yrs; started in growth; then moved to data infra
		- PM on Data Infra team: Unidash, metric 360, idata, daiquery
	- Metric catalogs - need to choice for Deltoid
		- MDF
		- Metric360
	- MDF vs Metric360
		- MDF is for experimentation only; every row is a user
		- M360 is not just for experimentation - central source of truth catalog that is governed
		- We are migrating MDF -> M360 for all new experiments; MDF will be legacy
		- Deltoid is now supporting M360
	- Problems
		- Holdout showed increase in metric, but topline doesn't show increase??
		- Not all m360 metrics are in deltoid
	- Use case: Unidash AI
		- User is exploring dashboard in unidash wants to understand which experiments are moving this metric
		- Give experiment metadata to unidash AI
		- We have a dependency on m360-deltoid migration
- 1-1 [[Steven Pousty]]
	- Intro
		- Background in academic ecology, with a lot of stats and ML
		- Moved from academia to software - worked a lot on containerization - Red Hat
		- Works at Red Hat open source programs office for pytorch and vllm
	- Steven's role and goals
		- Help Red Hat gain recognition in various communities
		- Especially for communities that are upstream packages for Red Hat (e.g. pytorch, vllm)
- 1-1 [[Anthony Annunziata]]
	- Intro
		- Physicist at IBM - started in technical research
		- Moved into deep learning research and quantum computing research
		- Then built AI for Science team as an org lead
		- Now leads open source at IBM
	- Meta + AIA
		- Started collab w/ Policy org + GenAI org - Joe Spizak etc.
		- Rob Sherman - VP Policy that owns relationship with AIA
		- Focus was about llama, trust and safety, evolving
		- Yann Lecun was also a supporter who convinced zuck to join
	- Goals
		- llama ecosystem: llama + API + llama-stack
		- open agent lab is about deployable implementations
- 1-1 [[Sathya Narayanan]]
	- Intro
		- Prof at CSU Monterey Bay - CSUMB
		- Works on many projects beyond teaching - connecting underprivileged students to opportunities
		- Runs institute called CTI - computing talent initiative
	- CTI
		- Open access for all students
		- Usually taking CS classes at community college or CSU
		- Run courses on academic success, and professional development - open
		- OSS partner - [[codeday.org]] - finds projects for students to partner with
		- Programs - fully online
			- Launch - getting started
			- Accelerate - professional development
	- Questions he's interested in
		- AI impact on teaching and learning
	- Opportunities
		- Launch - how to use AI as a learning partner vs. crutch
		- CSUMB Teaching - freshman physics + junior year CS professional seminar
		- Open source collab
	-
