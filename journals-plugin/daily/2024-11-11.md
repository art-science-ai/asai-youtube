		- Most IOPs (intensive outpatient programs) are focused on drug addiction recovery / rehab. There are few focused on anxiety depression - need to look out for those specifically.
- 1-1 [[Anne Kroeger]]
	- Intro
		- Creative offsite in SEA and in MPK for personal
		- Relocating to MPK; going to be lead for creative and guidance org in 
	- UXR - FTC issues
		- All functions that collect primary data - FTC commitments for data deletion requirements and processes for approvals etc.
		- FTC issues originated from negative publicity wrt FB emotion manipulation etc.
		- BPM may also ultimately get looped into FTC restrictions - but that's open question
	- FTC compliance for our AI app
		- Data deletion (intersect w/ legal hold): ensure that we delete data after certain time
			- What happens when legal hold is lifted? How to handle data deletion?
			- Can we have AI generated secondary sources? Unknown
		- Internal review and approval process for studies (vetting sensitive questions, etc.): ensure that we don't have sensitive data

	- Start with a few demand surfaces
		- Status tab - promoted channels / promo channels
		- Status - stories - insert ads slots within stories like IG stories 
	- Users choices
		- Linked users: Link WA to FB/IG -> cross app data sharing; global optimization across surfaces
		- Unlinked users: Do not link WA to FB/IG -> need to define various; accounts for 75%+ of LRP
	- Workstreams
		- Core Ads Growth - working on end to end delivery, ranking, ads manager (for linked users)
		- Unlinked users
			- Process data as per WAMO spec
			- Connect back to delivery and ranking
	- WA unlinked users consent
		- Need to mirror what's happening in Mon. side - SNA, LPA
		- Need to anonymize all 
	- WAMO vs. marketing messaging
		- MM is not an ads product; consumer subscribes to it first before business can send messages; MM + WAMO collaborating on having a tiered 
	- WAMO open questions - mostly on consent and user experience
	- Goals / milestones
		- No revenue goal; milestone goals still in discussion
		- Not yet finalized HC
