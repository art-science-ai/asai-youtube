## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Hongyu Liang]]
	- Top priorities
		- Customer understanding - we want to understand and validate customers
	- Key metrics
		- AI4E goals
			- Adoption
				- % of experiments assisted by AI; today 2%; by end of half get to 20%
		- EP top-line goals
			- Velocity
			- Quality / confidence
			- Safety - less SEVs - cross company workstream
		- AI4DA vs AI4E
			- AI4DA is a joint effort between CPP + AI data infra
			- Data team owns more of the key tools like scuba, daiquery, etc.
			- But they've done stuff that's very related to experimentation - like report generation - mostly for experimentation use case
	- Review doc
	- Other people
- Writing [[caude code commands]]

## Today's snippets
```txt
Hi, could you please clarify whether the screen share policy applies to all interviewers or only to SWE / coding interviews?

The post lists this policy under ALL INTERVIEWERS:
> ALL INTERVIEWERS > Screen Share and No Filter Policy - ACTION REQUESTED

But below that it says it's for coding interviews:
> We have implemented a screen-sharing protocol for coding interviews 

I'm a Product Manager, and our interviews typically don't involve any screen-sharing.
