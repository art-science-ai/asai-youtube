## Today's snippets
```
I really appreciate you taking the time to explain this in detail!

> Does that explain things a little more? Or not really?

Yes and no.

Yes — you've explained the techincal implementation (how you generate structured outputs) and benefits (consistency, latency, comprehensiveness, etc.) in detail.

No — you haven't provided any examples or explained how this is beneficial for developing an AI assistant.

Below are two examples of LLM structured outputs that are common use cases for AI assistants. I can see these are immediately useful for building an AI assistant because expense reports and recipes are things that end users care about.

I guess I'm not understanding if your solution is for such use cases or for some other use cases?

  

=== EXAMPLES ===

  

Expense reports:

```

{

"date": "2025-05-06",

"transactions": [

{

"merchant": "Starbucks",

"amount": 12.45,

"currency": "USD",

"category": "Food & Beverage"

},

{

"merchant": "Uber",

"amount": 23.10,

"currency": "USD",

"category": "Transport"

}

],

"total_amount": 35.55

}

```

  
Recipes:

```

{

"recipe_name": "Classic Pancakes",

"ingredients": [

{"item": "flour", "quantity": 2, "unit": "cups"},

{"item": "milk", "quantity": 1.5, "unit": "cups"},

{"item": "eggs", "quantity": 2, "unit": "pieces"},

{"item": "sugar", "quantity": 1, "unit": "tbsp"},

{"item": "salt", "quantity": 1, "unit": "pinch"}

],

"steps": [

"Mix all ingredients in a bowl until smooth.",

"Heat a skillet over medium heat.",

"Pour 1/4 cup batter per pancake and cook 3 minutes each side."

],

"cook_time_minutes": 6,

"servings": 4

}

```
```
