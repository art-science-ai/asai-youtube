PM levels

Hi Greg, hope you're doing well! We're hoping to publish the updated PM level distribution early next week, and this would be a good opportunity to address feedback we got last year about imbalanced level distributions.

Can you share any update on this comment you made here (it's the top most voted comment from last year's level distribution update thread 😊): https://fburl.com/workplace/a5k5h8s8

> I've been leading a workstream in PM X-Team the last few months looking at PM level distribution, the causes for the increase over time, and the changes we can make going forward.

It would be great if we could include some brief update or at least provide an ETA for an update together with the level distribution update.

LMK if I can help in any way - I'd be happy to contribute!
