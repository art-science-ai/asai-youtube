# Today's notes
```calendar-timeline
```
- [[Daily journal]] 
	- Journal
		- Today was another good morning! I even did my evening routine last night. I've been on a 3-day hot streak of every day exercise, daily planning, connecting, and meditating.
		- I think I also have the right order figured out for now, which is: written at bottom. Exercise so far is going well, but my cardio is kind of shot. On lower body days I can only do the two compound lifts T1 T2 and don't have capacity for any T3. Next session definitely start incorporating T3 - I mean next week. The vaping doesn't help here. I need to make a plan for quit vaping. Can bring this up at the next coaching session. Maybe after this long weekend and the next vape I stop.
		- Connecting is getting off to a good start too - reached out to Vivek yesterday and learned about him. Simple text outreach is working well. I'll reach out to Pranay today. Rotation can include friends and family. For now a 2-3 week timeline rotation is good. Maybe a month for good measure. Try to think of people I haven't reached out to in the last month. That way it'll force me to try to hit 30 people every month, which is a good amount.
		- Side projects going well, if a bit unfocused. Have some ideas for PM and AI articles to write. Getting started learning AI is going well, but am I putting too much thought into the structuring and drafting? I think so. I want to put blocks of time for freewriting where I don't do any structuring. Need to separate out structuring from the actual writing. Maybe I'll give this a try. Next focusmate session can just be a freewrite. That should be fun, and I used to enjoy it a lot too!
		- Connect: Pranay!
		  
		  Congrats on the new car! How are you guys doing and how's Rudra? Please share any latest pics!

		- + Good structure

			- upon probe - discussed time spent
	- Goals
		- + Defined clear goal: increasing time spent on Netflix (could have discussed more about the rationale)
		- + Discussed various sides of marketplace: consumers, creators, advertisers
		- +/- Prioritized consumer (could offer better rationale for this prioritization, or consider defining metrics for both creators + consumers)
	- Metrics
		- + Defined good metrics for creators
		- - Some metrics lacked clarity (e.g. listen duration)
		- +/- Top three metrics across different buckets
	- Trade-offs
		- + Downsides of adoption as north star
			- Not focusing on other parts of funnel

	- No show
- Planning [[iPhone set up]]
	- Reach out to someone who did iCloud backup
		- Hey Brandon! I wanted to follow up with you on this post [A] where you set up your new corporate iPhone using iCloud backup. 
		  
		  I noticed a few other posts mentioning that restoring from iCloud backup might result in problems with internal access, and I was wondering if you faced any such issues or if the process worked smoothly for you?
		  
		  I'm asking because I just got a new corporate iPhone and am trying to figure out the best way to transfer Whatsapp and other data from my old iPhone. Thanks in advance! 😊
