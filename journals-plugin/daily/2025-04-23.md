- [[Whatsapp]] feature request
	- Feature request: exclusion lists
	- Hi WhatsApp team, I love the new [Custom Lists](https://fb.workplace.com/groups/whatsappfyi/permalink/4085807498368056/) feature that lets me group specific chats. One improvement I'd love to see is the ability to exclude certain chats instead of only including them. This would allow for lists like “All chats except XYZ” which would be super helpful for managing my inbox. This is similar to the "focused inbox" feature in Outlook / Gmail. I would like to create a focused inbox that includes my 1-1 chats and small group chats, while excluding large group chats. Thanks for considering!

## Today's snippets
Feature request: exclusion lists

Hi WhatsApp team, I love the new Lists feature that lets me group specific chats. One improvement I'd love to see is the ability to exclude certain chats instead of only including them. This would allow for dynamic lists like “All chats except X, Y, Z” which would be super helpful for managing my inbox. Thanks for considering!
