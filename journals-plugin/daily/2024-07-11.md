	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- Hmm... again yesterday I didn't get great sleep. Didn't go to bed on time. Also suffering this time from some nicotine withdrawals so that may be making things a bit off. But I did get the zyn pouches so that should be good. I think it's a good transition. That defs helps the withdrawal stuff way better than lozenges. Maybe the next step down can be the lozenges / mints and then I can quit completely. Few weeks plan. Stay strong!
		- But I should prioritize sleep regardless. What's a good way to make that happen? Other than just forcing myself to respect the bedtime alarm? At some point I should start tracking the bed-time routine better and that should be my next priority. Next quarter I can prioritize that. Bed time routine is next. 
		- What else on my mind? Mentoring thing is kind of starting to become a pain. I'm not super enjoying the general PM mentoring I think. I want to focus more on AI. Need to start writing more. Experiment with various ideas to write about. Do the thing about starting with short posts on Linkedin and expanding them into longer content. Need some structure like a database of possible topics to write about and mapping content to that. Zettelkasten is supposed to help with that, maybe I need to give it another shot? Start with simple folder organization for now until I figure out the whole file classes thing. I think that can be a later optimization. DB folder is actually a great start. Then I can get into how to optimize that with file classes. Okay, these are some good ideas!
