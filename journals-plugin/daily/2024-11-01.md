## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Guang Li]]
	- Wanted me to provide more clarity on PXFN
- 1-1 [[Dave Nielsen]]
	- AI Alliance: Meta + IBM context
		- Meta: interested in policy advocacy and improve their public perception and thought leadership around data and AI
		- IBM: establish reputation with enterprise customers for trust, safety, compliance, etc. w.r.t. AI ; provide technical guidance and thought leadership; data prep toolkit, open trusted data initiative, etc.; 
	- Education focus area
		- AI curriculum project
			- IBM internal project: curriculum for non-technical people who want to learn AI > intermediate level curriculum > advanced 
			- IBM wants to provide this curriculum for certifications, etc.
			- Dave wants to take this content and open it up as Github repo
			- Can we create something separate from AI alliance perspective?
		- Data for AI workshops
			- workshop on end to end data prep flow for AI chatbot
			- not directly for education, but goes across all working groups
			- For enterprise customers
			- Less interesting to me
	- Community initiatives
		- External events
			- What's worked so far: identify conferences and in-person events on AI to organize in-person gatherings
		- Internal connections
			- Members give 15 min presentations internally about their projects
			- Can be at the individual working group level
			- What are other ways to enable and strengthen internal connections?
		- Building frameworks for community external events
			- Budget, speakers, etc.
		- Website review and update
		- Member communication process under development
