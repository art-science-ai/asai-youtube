## Today's notes
- AI4E weekly update msg
	- Hi all, Han is on PTO today and has requested me to run the weekly meeting and post the weekly update.
	- This is my first time doing this, so I'd appreciate if you could provide detailed progress updates. I've included a dedicated section in our weekly sync doc where you can enter your progress updates: https://fburl.com/gdoc/pdpp0yg6
	- Btw, I'm in MPK today (sitting at Han's desk) so please feel free to swing by and say hello! 👋
- 1-1 [[Frank Chen]]
	- Intro
		- Focus on EP Privacy and Better Engineering (SEC)
- Mark & Yang
	- Hi both, I'd love to join this meeting but unfortunately I have a conflict at this time. Do you mind if I reschedule to 3:30pm PT which looks open on both of your calendars?
