Hey Ananth, hope you're doing well! We are working on some high priority OBA launches for Value Optimization model, and we are currently breaching the empirical DP AUC threshold in some cases [A].

One ask from VO leadership was to explore with your team about the possibility of relaxing the empirical DP threshold, and I wanted to get your thoughts on this?

We also have a meeting for Mon 4/7 at 9:05 AM, but I wanted to reach out in advance to share context and get some initial thoughts from you. Thanks in advance! :)
