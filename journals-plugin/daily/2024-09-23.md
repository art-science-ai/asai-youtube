## Today's journal
- Morning routine
	- [ ] Exercise
	- [x] Meditation
	- [x] Journal 5-10m
	- [x] Connect
	- [ ] Tasks + Calendar + Focusmate

		- [ ] Calendar: write meeting agendas, fill in empty blocks with focusmate priorities
	- [ ] Habit tracker

	- Reflect: What's on my mind today?
		- I was thinking about exercise - what's a quick 5-10 minute routine I can do for exercise? Have a variety of things I can choose from
		- [[Exercise]] routines
			- 5-10 mins KB swings EMOM
			- 5-10 mins molding mobility
			- 5-10 mins burpees (+ pullups optional) EMOM
			- 20 mins starting strength
			- 30 mins running
			- 45 mins slow running
		- That's a good list. Often when I don't want to do exercise, it's easy to do something simple like molding mobility. If I can do that 3 times a day even that would be great. How about splitting exercise into 3 routines I do for 10 mins x 3 times over the day. That's a great start. Often I don't do something because I think it will be a lot of work or very intense.
		- [[Connect habit]] routines
			- Browse social media and reach out based on that
			- Browse high priority friends and family list to keep in touch with
	- Connect: reach out to someone

	- Product Context: 
		- wholesale electricity market has price fluctuation and spikes; lower efficiency providers have higher costs and prices; SG regulators need to keep total demand low; 
		- when there's high demand, regulator needs to respond to demand; e.g. lowering load of consumers by using battery power; Company can keep 33% of cost savings due to easing demand
		- End consumers are on fixed electricity contracts - fixed price
	- Tish's product: Flex
		- Zero to one product - they've been thinking about it for 2 yrs, but no PM to drive
		- Tish needs to deliver the product / MVP by January
		- B2b product; customer is Singapore regulator - see product context section
