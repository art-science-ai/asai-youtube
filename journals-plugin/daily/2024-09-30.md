## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Cindy Arellano]]
	- I gave her context on SG + nonSG
- 1-1 [[Sha Meng]]
	- Sha is very pleased with the summit - many leads gave us attention and positive feedback
	- SAIL + SEAR strategy
		- Not sure if we should combine
		- Don't combine for now - keep separate 
	- SAIL review
		- Org level review - not for SGI - focus on RAI level
		- We can broadcast this later, but not a strategy
	- SEAR
		- SEAR is a solution for Track 4
		- Review w SGI leads - care about problem, results, and iRev
		- Review w RAI leads - care more about solution and AI innovations vs. impact and applications
