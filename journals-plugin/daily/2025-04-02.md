## Today's snippets
Follow up [[Jon Paris]]
```txt
Hi Jon, I had a 1-1 with Kalpana last Wednesday. We spent a lot of time diving into my background and my passion for AI, which went really well. However, as the conversation shifted toward design, it became clear that her vision for the role leans more toward a “Design Tools PM” rather than an “AI for Productivity PM.” As such, she seems to be looking for a PM who is primarily passionate about Design Tools, for which I may not be the ideal candidate.

I haven't heard back from Kalpana since our 1-1 last Wednesday, but Mark reached out to me earlier today to check-in on how things were going, and I shared the same update with him. Anyway, I hope you enjoy your PTO, and I'll check-in with you again next week on some of the other follow-ups we discussed! 😊
