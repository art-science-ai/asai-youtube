		- Good job with morning routine today - it went very well. Had some resistance to starting in the beginning, lazed in bed - likely because of poor sleep previous night - but then got up and did my exercise and rest of routine. I feel good now that I did it, yay!
		- Yesterday was a good day. It felt good to get a quasi endorsement from Yuhui that he would support my case for promo. Also felt good that in general I'm finding a balanced way to make progress on my career, life, and interests in general. Things are going well!
		- I still have some tasks and things to do. This week is a bit chill Friday because I don't have the podcast to do. That's pushed to Sunday. Use this as an opportunity to make progress on my remaining content planning for the podcast. That's what I should focus on today. Not just content planning, but also some content writing, starting with the post for Paula. Make it a goal that Paula's post should go out today.

Hey Marvin! This doc [A] explains the VO collab. One of the tracks under there is "Signal Growth Ranking" for which Sagar made me the PM QB. This is what we are also tracking under SAIL where we delivered 0.07% iRev in H1 and plan to deliver 0.06% iRev in H2 [B] by shipping SGRAI techniques, and I'm familiar with this track. 

I'll be working with the team to come up with a napkin ask for this track including opportunity sizing and HC ask for 2025. We are targeting to review and finalize internally by end of August.

I met with the Ads AI team yesterday:

> Ads AI is a generative AI agent powered by Llama 3 that provides advertisers with real-time guidance and support by answering general product and support questions, monitoring and debugging delivery issues, and offering campaign optimisation advice.

source: https://fb.workplace.com/groups/1381603932406757/permalink/1594257161141432/

There is a lot of overlap between their project and ours. In fact, Gaby's suggested architecture was to build our use case as a module of the existing "Ads AI" agent.

I met with the lead PM (Lea Yu from Tak's org) and lead PMM (Candice Mizushima from Tulika's org), and they were very supportive of our initiative. Candice said she would sync w/ Victor and between the two of them can provide PMM support for our initiative
