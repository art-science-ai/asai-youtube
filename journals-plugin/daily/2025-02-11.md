- Chat w [[Payam Shodjai]]
	- So, this is the first time I'm exploring a new role since joining Meta in 2022-H1 and I think I don't have a good sense of what to expect / prepare for in these conversations. I was focusing on demonstrating my technical competence and subject matter expertise (i.e. my understanding of the customers, pain points, and use cases). I didn't realize that I was expected to discuss long-term product strategy and vision, but I should have done a better job clarifying expectations.
	  
	  I'd be happy to prepare for a conversation focused on this topic if you're open to reconsidering. If not, I understand, and I'd love to be considered for any future opportunities in the AI 4 Productivity space! 😊 	  
- Chat w/ [[Dare Obasanjo]] [[Ken Ebbitt]]

	- Intro - Arun
		- Meta commerce team (order management system) -> hit with signal loss -> bring experience onsite - Arun worked on this; also for Marketplace
		- Joined Dev AI for code compose - late 2023
		- Code compose shifted to other team, then these guys shifted to Ricardo
	- Intro - Ricardo
		- Using ReAct loop - loops through tools and actions
		- Tools - reading a file, searching code examples, reading task/wiki
		- Actions - run linter, tests, etc.
	- Automated use cases - tasks which have ground truth
		- Headless non-interactive loop till it determines it's done, then we run unit tests
		- Developed by attaching agent to test diffs - they landed tests and got reviewed by human
	- Human based tasks - no ground truth
		- Entry points - natural language text or you can put a task in the tool
		- Collaborating w/ agent
			- Pause the agent - provide natural language hint
	- Ricardo workflow
		- Start new project
		- Modify existing project
