	- Hey dude, I understand where you're coming from, and this is completely fair chastisement. If I were in your position, I'd feel the same way. I understand I've been super unreliable, and there's no good excuse.
	- I've been traveling all month and will be back on Sunday. Can I request time until early next week to get back to you with a plan of action? I'll commit to some specific actionable steps and hold myself accountable.
	- Let me know if there are specific things I can do before the call on July 2.
