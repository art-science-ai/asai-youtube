## Today's notes
- 1-1 [[Guang Li]]
	- ~1.4-1.5% GAS; reduced due to V&C including CDP
	- Infra ML - requirement is unclear
		- We are trying to avoid general platformization - want to focus on 1 or 2 projects to start with. Start with flywheel 1 and extrapolate from there.
		- They already build something on their side - common components - e.g. label growth
	- Backchannel minghao li krishna
		- Downplay infra
		- Avoid making it a platform play
		- Focus on project ideas
		- Focus on accelerating the project ideas rather than generic capability
- 1-1 w [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Marvin Kim|Marvin Kim]]
	- Problem: chicken-egg problem on adv side and internal side
	- Solution: 
	- Phase 1: throw people at the problem to solve for both internal and external use cases
	- Phase 2: Build an acceleration platform - for internal signals
	- Phase 3: Ask for 
	- Revised framing
		- Problem: 
			- Main problem: Chicken-and-egg problem between data and ML; we don't know what new data is most valuable for Ads delivery optimization, because we are unable to quickly experiment with new signals
			- Sub-problem: Signals > ML channel
			- Sub-problem: ML > signals channel
			- Sub-problem: Advertisers > Meta channel

## Snippets
[[Reverse shadow bottleneck]]
Problem 1:

(1) There is a large backlog of PMs (~500+) who are unable to complete PM interview training due to the reverse shadow bottleneck. However, the number of trained PM interviewers is sufficient for the foreseeable pipeline of PM interview candidates, so there may be no business critical need to accelerate PM interview training.

(2) We're still working on finding low hanging fruit to unblock the interview training pipeline, but in general PMs need to start looking for other areas to drive Capacity / Org contribution initiatives.

Hey, thank you so much for making this happen — I really appreciate it! 😊

Unfortunately the ICS integration is super buggy, and it's not working for me. Mentorcal is showing me as busy for several times when I am not busy.

You can test it yourself using my ICS link (please don't share this link): https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/a3aa1e5a19e942d884226931659b5ddf@meta.com/00d5d848d67b4dfb89c8bb60e93116658788616713736613722/S-1-8-588929841-1055636683-2520604268-2886053264/reachcalendar.ics

Test the link here first and it's working fine: https://icscalendar.com/preview/

Now compare the result against what you see in the MentorCal troubleshooting UI, and you'll see it looks very different.

I also tested on cal.com and it has the same bugs. So I don't think MentorCal is introducing new bugs, but there are underlying bugs in the way cal.com is handling ICS feeds.
