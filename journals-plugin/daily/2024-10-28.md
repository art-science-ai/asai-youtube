	- Goals: work
		- Going pretty well; aligning w/ Marvin
	- Goals: side project
		- adplist.com - mentor platform

		- Increase frequency - daily 15m
- Guang / Yuhui PSML / DMF
	- PSML x Data Flywheel
	- Hi Yuhui and Guang, wanted to get your thoughts on the relationship between PSML and Data Flywheel. As we're working on developing roadmaps (incl. milestones, GAS, BIS and capacity allocation, etc.), it would be helpful for us to drive more clarity on how to handle areas of overlap (e.g. Semantic Ranking, MIDAS).

-  [[PM interview]] [[Musical Instruments Product Sense]] reverse shadow from [[Barun M.]]
	- Intros (2m)
		- PM at TikTok Shops - ecommerce marketplace - business apps and integrations
	- Question
		- Create a product to help people learn a musical instrument remotely
		- This is not a product Meta is building - imagine you're the founding PM at a new startup building this product
	- Notes - raw
		- Overall
		- Product Motivation and Context: solid
		- Determining Target Audience: moderate/solid
		- Problem Identification: solid
		- Solution Development: solid/strong
	- Feedback from Barun
		- How I ran the interview
			- Target audience: i did a good job of probing; I did a good job making him summarize
			- Did a good job of time management
		- Review feedback and ratings
			- Product motivation: solid or strong
			- Target audience: Barun thinks it was below solid; prioritization was just a combination of the new segments he listed; slightly less than solid
			- Pain points: all good, agree
			- Solution: feel empowered to skip parts - e.g. don't prioritize solutions just pick one and solve it; Barun thinks we could have spent more time on the solution deep dive
		- Me steering the candidate
			- In some cases I was steering the candidate a lot
		- General tips
			- Icebreaker at the beginning - get the interviewee start talking about something to get the jitters out - especially if they're nervous
			- Set the stage for what a product sense interview is and what's expected
			- Rating: wait few hours before giving the final rating
	- Summary
		- Candidate has strong communication skills and demonstrated a solid approach to structured brainstorming and prioritization across all areas of the Product Sense interview. Solid+ across all categories except audience segmentation, where he failed to think broadly and was somewhat resistant to interviewer coaching and feedback.
	- Final notes
	```txt
	Product Motivation and Context
	+ Identified why this problem is important: learning music costs a lot of time and money
	+ Identified clear mission statement: "making a musical instrument effective and enjoyable to do remotely"
	+ / - Did not expound in detail to begin with, but upon prompting, candidate was able to speak in detail about what the mission means. 
	- Could have thought more broadly about the problem space.
	
	
	Determining Target Audience
	+ Defined a broad set of stakeholders and discussed the role of each stakeholder: learners, teachers, stores, manufacturers, bands, school
	+/- Defined only one user segmentation (level of experience with music). Took multiple follow-ups to get the candidate to define more segmentations (access, purchasing power, etc.)
	+ Prioritized target segment (low experience, not in school, low purchasing power) with clear reasoning (but no structured prioritization framework) 
	- Did not use a structured prioritization framework
	
	
	Problem Identification
	+ Listed good set of 6 pain points: hard to learn basics, motivation to practice, getting feedback, step by step instruction, finding a place to practice, cost
	+ Prioritized each pain point based on impact and reach, talked through the logic for why impact and reach are high/low for each item
	- Did not map out user journey which could have led to broader problem identification
	+/- Was reluctant to prioritize the top pain point; even when probed, insisted on prioritizing top 2 pain points (getting feedback + practice/motivation) vs. top 1
	
	
	Solution Development
	+ Considered broad set of solutions: marketplace, tutorials with in-app tests, challenges with crowdsourced feedback, computer vision feedback
	- Solution list was not MECE and had a lot of overlap
	+ Clearly prioritized based on impact (defined as how much it solves the pain point we chose - good definition) and effort for each item; prioritized tutorials with in-app tests
	+ Provided a clear walkthrough of the user experience: submitting recording, getting grades and recommendations, showing progress towards goal; able to speak in a lot of detail to each component of the experience
	
	
	Misc
	+ Laid out a clear structure and framework
	+ Good communication and presentation skills
	- Seemed a little resistant to coaching and change of direction from interviewer (e.g. when probed to do broader user segmentation, candidate was not very flexible)

- 1-1 w [[Sha Meng]]
	- AI4P context
		- Program set-up is very top-down; Santanu level discussions to formalize the collaborations
		- Bottom-up collaborations are all from SAIL, but top-down is from RAI side
	- PM set up
		- Because it's an "AI4..." area, they probably put Neeraj on this
		- Sha + Marvin had a brief chat on this; AI4P is umbrella but individual workstreams is where work is happening
	- AI4P/SAIL types of collaborations
		- High touch - e.g. VO, we're embedded in the product org
		- Medium touch - e.g. CTX, we are solution provider
		- Low touch - automation - go w TTH
	- AI4P - which collaborations to cover
		- There are existing ongoing collaborations that are not part of AI4P - e.g. Wenlin's org collabs w/ other orgs
	- Options for SAIL / Tetris / AI4P
		- Merge SAIL -> AI4P
			- Upside: 
			- Downside: we'll cover SG med touch part but nonSG medium touch part
		- AI4P will exclude 
-
