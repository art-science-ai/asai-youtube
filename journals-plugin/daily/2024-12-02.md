## Today's notes
- working w [[Synth V]] [[AI vocal]]
	- Reddit guy who used it for hindi / urdu vocals:
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/SynthesizerV/comments/15zs2f7/i_made_an_urduhindi_cover_of_bad_apple/lzzyx59/
	- Tip: use Japanese language
	- But the r sounds is sometimes l
	- Synth V phoneme reference: https://dreamtonics.com/svstudio-resources/
	- Synth V user manual: https://svdocs.dreamtonics.com/en/synthv/advanced-usage/note-properties
-  Status of [[shakti sahita ganapatim]]
	- Have melody + harmony - decent shape
	- Drummer - TODO - quick garageband setup
	- Vocal - swaras are good, but lyrics are not coming through
	- Options for vocal
		- generation
			- AI generation via SynthV / ACE - phonemes difficulty
			- Recording vocals and re-pitching
				- Re-pitch trial
				- Logic pro trial
		- transformation
			- Use kits pre-trained model
			- Train my custom voice model
- VO + SG Ranking meeting review w [[Imports/logseq-2023-04-06 sanitized for import/pages/Sagar Pilania|Sagar Pilania]] [[Lin Li]] [[Fan Yuan]]
	- SL Headroom explanation
		- Follow up on headroom
	- Goaling for each item
		- Follow up on key metrics to goal on
	- Steven: model consolidation impact
		- No conflict or impact
		- Steve: but are these separate efforts? Yes, these are sep. efforts but execution is joint
- Researching [[Synth V]] phonemes and pronunciation
	- Synth V converts text to phonemes using grapheme to phoneme algorithms
	- Phonemes can be mapped to IPA via
		- Arpabet - English
		- Romaji - Japanese
		- XSAMPA - Chinese, Spanish
- 1-1 [[Jonathan Herbach]]
	- General intro
		- His kids are singing music - he just got back from the concert
		- He was in choir in school and college
	- Had a friendly conversation about collaboration challenges
		- His perspective: didn't want to have more people add to a doc
	- Jonathan's alignment on offline
		- Already crawled stuff - everyone's okay w/ that
		- New crawls - Jonathan is aligning w/ Austin that this should be okay - even without changing user agent; 
		- legal is fine w/ external documentation; volume is small and it's temporary
		- Key trade-off
			- If we continue to use existing agent, less work for catalog team but less transparency
			- If we switch to new agent, we likely lose coverage
	- Volume of crawls
		- Confirm that volume is small for "new crawls" for temporary basis
		- baseline - 130 mil crawls
		- 3-5 mil SG; want to go up to 20 mil/day
		- 1 mil RAI; want to go up to 15 mil/day
	- LAMA sequencing
		- One LAMA for landing pages
		- One LAMA for IABs - follow-up
	- Where he needs help
		- Short term - url crawl analysis
- 1-1 [[Shuyan Li]]
	- Opportunity for sizing
		- Headroom formula = Rev share * efficiency boost
	- We can use existing table
- 1-1 [[Matt Pellegrino]]
	- Catch-up
		- Had a baby 8 weeks ago - Thea
		- Back to work in Jan - after 12 weeks of pat leave and some phased return stuff
	- Interview status
		- Meta is the only thing in the pipeline right now
		- Final round - next week Tuesday + Thursday
		- First round went okay - feedback
			- Time management - be more concise
			- Product sense needed a repeat
