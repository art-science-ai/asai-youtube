		- Hi, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to kindly check on the status of your conference room booking in MPK22 for tomorrow (Tuesday 07/22).
		  
		  My team is looking for a room in MPK22 from 1:30 to 2:00 PM for about 20 people for a team offsite session. If your plans have changed or if there’s a last-minute cancellation, would the room be available during that time?
		  
		  Thank you very much in advance for your help, and apologies for any inconvenience!
