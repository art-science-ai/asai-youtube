	- Hi everyone, here's an interim update on some of the action items we discussed at last week's meeting. I just want to make sure everyone is aligned on #2 before we start operationalizing it, and I'll share an update when we have the concrete numbers for H2 roadmapping.

## Today's snippets
On a separate topic, the lack of clarity on T2/T4 iRev attribution seems to be negatively impacting roadmap collaboration. In particular, teams are uncertain how to prioritize cross-track projects vs. intra-track projects.

To address this concern, I'd like to tag all of us on this draft post re-iterating our commitment to continued collaboration with a Meta-first mindset. I would appreciate any feedback on this draft before I share it (ETA: Monday afternoon).

=== DRAFT POST: Update on Consumer Journey Ads Data Use goals for Signal Growth Priority ===

As we work towards our shared goal of maximizing iRev impact by leveraging Consumer Journey signals for Ads data use, Signal Growth Priority (SGP) Track 2 + Track 4 leads have aligned on the following principles to guide roadmapping:

- **Meta-first mindset**: Our primary focus is on maximizing iRev and ROI to benefit Meta as a whole, regardless of which Priority / Track accounts for the impact.
- **SGP  goals**: To streamline roadmapping, all Consumer Journey ads data use goals will fall under a single SGP track: MLDU (f.k.a. Track 4). We will no longer have a separate goal category for Track 2 + Track 4 shared goals.
- **Prioritizing impact over attribution**: Team level attribution will be separate from SGP track level goals. Individual contributors and teams working on projects will always receive credit for their impact, regardless of which track the goals belong to.
