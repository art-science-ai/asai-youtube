#### Summit post
Pinned: key information and announcements

This pinned post contains all the key information needed for the SG Ranking AI Summit 2024-H2

Key links and info
- Agenda doc (includes links to presentations)
- WP Group + Chat
- WP Event (with calendar invite)

Key announcements
- Session Q&A: Please add your questions to the WP livestream. There will be limited time for Q&A, but we encourage you to follow up with speakers after the session (e.g. during Happy Hour).
- Timing: All the summit sessions will start and end exactly on-time as specified in the agenda. Recordings will be shared after the session for anything you might have missed.
- Communication: Please use the WP Group + Chat for any questions or concerns. Please do not individually message the organizers, as they will be unable to monitor and respond to individual chats. 
- Happy Hour: Please prioritize the summit happy hour (details in agenda) as an opportunity to connect in-person!

Additional announcements for presenters
- Moderation: Each session has a dedicated moderator who will moderate the session and project presentations from their laptop (see moderators listed in agenda: Sha Meng Nikhil Maddirala Jin Zhu Bowen Gong Hang Li (Ads CoreML) Sam Elshamy Fei Huang).
- Virtual presenters: Please join the session using the Zoom link for presenters: Day 1 | Day 2. No need to share your screen (moderators will cover that). Please instruct the moderator when to proceed to the next slide.
- Timing: It is essential for all presenters to stick to the allotted time in the agenda. The moderator will have to cut you off and move to the next session at the allotted time, because there is no additional buffer time.
- Presentation links: Please add your presentation links to the agenda doc by 5pm today (even if incomplete) and ensure that your presentations have general viewing access for “Monetization + Partners”.
