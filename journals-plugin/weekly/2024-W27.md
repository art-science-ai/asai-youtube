# This week's notes
```calendar-timeline
```

- Weekly review
	- [ ] Tasks + Calendar + Focusmate
	- [ ] Update journal templates
	- [ ] Habit tracking
- [[Weekly journal]] 
	- Notes
		- This week is a short week in terms of productivity. Only 3 days. This points to that I should think about weeks not only in terms of productivity, but also in terms of other areas of my life!
	- Plan: This week's top priorities
		- work: make a career development plan and project plan for 2024-Q3
		- side-projects: ai learning resources draft
		- personal: have fun on vacation!
	- Plan: Try something different
		- Consistently stick to habits! Even while traveling, do 10-min morning routine with all habits.
	- Reflect: What went well this week?
		- Great job on 2/3 of the weekly priorities - work and personal
		- Had an amazing vacation and came back with ideas to bring back to daily life!
	- Reflect: What didn't go well this week?
		- Side-project - didn't make as much progress as hoped, especially on the writing side. Need to incorporate freewrites for that.
